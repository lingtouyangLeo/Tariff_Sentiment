Our business fundamentals and market tailwinds are strong, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the second half and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star 1 on your touchtone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that will be star 1 if you would like to signal with questions. And our first question will come from Mark Mordler with Bernstein. Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter and especially the strong net new ARR. I'd like to ask a little more color on specifically the net new ARR that we saw in Creative Cloud. Can you give us a sense of what the contribution, near-term, medium-term, to digital ARR from seat growth versus upsell versus consumption, things like Adobe Stock and AI credits, even rank ordering or quantifying, anything you can give us to give us a sense of what's driving that number. And... And that would be very helpful in really understanding what's going on in the drivers of that number. Thanks. Sure, Mark. Let me start, and then certainly David and Dan can add. To your point, we had a strong quarter, and I think what's really driving the quarter big picture continues to be the innovation that we're delivering. And, you know, the way AI is actually making our applications more both more affordable, easy to onboard, as well as, frankly, higher value uses. New users are still a big driver of the growth that we continue to see in the business. On the Document Cloud side, a lot of that has to do with the introduction of AI Assistant and the fact that people are migrating to the higher value products. And on Creative Cloud, I would say the things that we're doing on imaging with Firefly and what we've seen both in Photoshop and Lightroom. I think in the prepared remarks, Dan certainly talked about what's happening with also each of the different segments. So the SMB segment actually had a strong quarter. Enterprise continues to have a strong quarter. So, you know, across the board, Mark, we actually saw strength in the business. And our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on just an incredible result. I wanted to ask kind of just similar to Mark's question, just how much of a Gen AI demand did you see in the quarter in terms of sort of both the Creative Cloud portfolio and digital media? you know, in Creative Studio as well as in GenEd Studio? And how does it kind of help to pick up more on the enterprise side of the business and the SMB side of the business? Help us understand that progression and maybe how you're planning forward in the back half of the DNA or our guide. Sure, Alex. Again, maybe I'll start with that. And, you know, just taking a step back, I think we've talked about, you know, the platform that we have for GenAI that, you know, constitutes, data as well as models and finally interfaces. On the models, we released Firefly services. We've started to see some customer wins in Firefly services. So they're using it for variations and these are the custom models that we're creating as well as access to APIs. I would say that's early in terms of the adoption, but the interest as customers say how they can ingest their data into our models as well as custom models. That's really ahead of us, and we expect that to continue to grow in Q3 and Q4. I think the biggest opportunity for us and why we're really excited about Gen AI is in the interfaces, because that's the way people derive value, whether it's in being able to complete their tasks faster, whether it's be able to do new workflows. And I would say in that particular space, Acrobat has really seen a significant amount of usage as it relates to AI Assistant and Photoshop. I'll have David again add, but generative fill and what we are doing there, what we are doing in Illustrator, and that both for existing customers as well as for prospects who now come in and say, the products are becoming increasingly more productive for us. That's what's really driving the value there. And last but not least, you know, the AI first applications. When we think of an application like Express, Express is all about reimagining what we can do for creatives by, you know, sort of leapfrogging existing technologies and providing an AI first application. And so that's also off to a good start. Yeah. And just to add to a little bit of what Shantanu said, Alex, um, You know, we've talked a lot about how FY23 was the year that AI was in the playground, and this is the year we need to bring it into production. And a lot of that is industry-wide, but we're in a pretty special position as a release to that. So to Shantanu's point, a lot of active releases this quarter, right? Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly updates in Photoshop, Firefly was introduced for the first time into Lightroom. Express Mobile launched, Express for Business launched. We launched Firefly services for enterprises to produce content at scale. So as you can see, there was a ton of innovation in our core applications around generative AI. You put that together with some of the activations that we've done at Summit, and we did a Max London, and we're getting our word out very broadly that it starts to create this ability to not just look at and play with AI, but actually use it as part of your workflow. So that's been deeply integrated into everything we do, and that's the key point. The interfaces that people work at, if we bring AI there, everyone becomes more productive. Maybe one last thing, Alex. Sequentially, if you look at it from a route to market, digital had a very strong quarter as it relates to what we did on Adobe.com. We had talked about enterprise doing well in Q1 as well. That continued. And SMB also, the interest in our team's product also continued to do really well. So I think sequentially, I would point to SMB and digital strength as driving, you know, the further growth. That's super helpful. And then maybe just one on the macro, just giving your guys' purview. what is the story that you're seeing in terms of the macro and the demand environment? Clearly, again, you're commenting on solid performance in the SMB and in the enterprise. Is there any areas that you're seeing pockets of weaknesses that really vertical dependent? Just maybe give a comment on kind of how we should think about it as we look for the rest of the year. I think from a macro perspective, what I think differentiates Adobe... more than any other company, is how differentiated and how diverse the set of products that we have. And again, from individual consumers all the way to enterprises, our products are mission critical. And so at this scale, it's all about execution. And the business cycles will come and go, Alex, but we're actually continuing to focus on execution and converting the pipeline and the interest and the awareness of AI into monetization. And so we just will be ruthlessly focused on continuing to execute against that. So nothing really to report different on the macroeconomic environment from our perspective. Awesome. Keep doing what you're doing. And our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and echo the congrats on the quarter. Maybe for both you, Shantanu, and David, you know, there are clearly just so many layers to the Firefly monetization story. But I think one theme that's coming out a little bit in this call, and particularly interesting route to monetize, is just the increased engagement that Firefly helps drive in your flagship products, right? Or I think what we call sort of the interfaces, right? An example there would be like Generative Fill for Photoshop. And you've clearly started expanding that to other flagships like Premiere and Illustrator. Maybe to go one level deeper, is there a way that you think about the potential opportunity from things like higher retention rates or any other way that, I know it's really tough to size, but how have you sort of thought about it even qualitatively? Yeah, it's a great question. And yeah, the core has been from the very beginning, we've talked to you guys about our primary focus for generative AI is about user adoption and proliferation, right? And that has continued to be the primary thing on our mind. And it's the primary thing on our mind for multiple reasons. And to your point, there are many different ways that we can monetize this. First is, you know, as you think about the growth algorithms that we always have in our head, it always starts with, as Shantanu said, New users, right? And then it's about getting more value to existing users at higher ARPU, right? So in the context of new users, first and foremost, you know, we want to make sure that everything we're doing generative AI is embedded in our tools, starting with Express, right? So we have Express in the market. We're seeing a lot of adoption and usage of Express in the market. As that's happening, we're infusing generative AI more and more into Express in a whole host of ways. And that's really helping everything from our marketing message for the completeness of the AI offering in there all the way through to user engagement and success and onboarding and retention. Similarly, though, this is having the same effect in our core creative products as well, right? The introduction of Firefly. combined with some of the product-led growth work we've been doing, in particular something called the context bar, makes it easy for new users coming in to just be more successful out of the gate, which then, of course, helps with both conversion and retention. And then with AI Assistant, the ability to sort of embed that into the purchase flow for Acrobat and get a high attach rate. We always talk about that as a would you like fries with it moment at Adobe when someone's going through the checkout flow. It's just a great way for people to say, look, this is value I want. I want to add it and buy up to the higher plan. So there are a lot of different mechanisms that we see. But by far, the strongest is going to be the fact that we are seeing people like in Creative Cloud migrating to the higher price plans because they include Firefly. And so we just want to get more value to these users as well. And in terms of the generation, Saket, I think we talked about it. We did a great job at Max in London talking about some of the new functionality and releasing Photoshop. I think we're up to 9 billion generations. And actually, I think the greatest amount of generations was in May. So the momentum clearly is the more we integrate this functionality into our interfaces, the more that usage is really driving adoption as well as retention. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. And our next question comes from Brent Phil with Jefferies. David, on Express, you mentioned the success you're seeing. Can you maybe drill in to some of the other metrics and accomplishments that you're seeing out of Express to score? Yeah. For starters, you know, there's a lot of buzz at Express here at Adobe coming off the event we just had earlier this week, but It's really based on the fact that the innovation in Express is on a tear. A few months ago, we introduced an all-new Express for the web. This quarter, we introduced an all-new Express for mobile. We introduced Express for business. We also now have, as we just talked about, been more deeply integrating AI features, whether it's for imaging generation or gender to fill or text effects, character animation, design generations. more deeply into the flow for Express. And that combination has led to an incredible set of metrics over the last quarter in particular, but building throughout the year. ExpressMail is going very quickly. We talked about in the script earlier that on mobile has more than doubled quarter of a quarter, which is fantastic to see. And cumulative exports, if you look at year over year, has grown by over 80%. So really feeling good about sort of the momentum we're seeing. But if you take a step back, I think it is important to take a step back and understand our vision. Express that is now in market is built on a brand new platform, right? And that brand new platform lays the groundwork for the AI era. and this will be, Express will be the place that anyone can come and create through a combination of conversational and standard inputs. That's the vision that we have, and I think it's an opportunity for us to really leap forward in terms of what we can do on the web and mobile at Adobe. And, you know, it's taken us a little time to get here. It hasn't happened overnight, but now that we are here, we are going to pour the gas on go-to-market, right? You know what we can do with our data-driven operating model We've been ramping up what we're doing in digital and Adobe.com journeys. We now can do the same thing and unleash all of that expertise in the mobile app store. You know what we're capable in terms of our product-led growth motions. We have now embedded Express workflows into Acrobat Editor. We obviously have been embedding it into Creative Cloud workflows. And also, as we showed at Summit with Anil, we've embedded it into our Experience Cloud workflows as well. In addition to all of that, we're now unleashing our Insight Salesforce to target the small, medium businesses. Our education teams are really gearing up for the back-to-school launch for K-12 and higher ed. And our field and enterprise sales now have Express for Business. And we're doing all this globally, right? It's a massive market, and we're ramping up, and we're ready to go. Thank you. And the next question comes from Greg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Hey, thank you very much, and my congratulations. For your creative business, how are you thinking about the Q side of the P times Q equation over the balance of the year? Based on these numbers anyway, I would certainly assume that you had really healthy unit growth in Q2, and I'm wondering if you expect that to continue. Yeah, I mean, again, I think it is this mix of product innovation that we've been putting out there and the steady drumbeat of that. A lot of it getting attention because of the quality and the hooks of AI and being able to sort of bring people onboarding them quickly and successfully into the product. And then As we talked about, the more they use these AI features, the more they retain, and we feel really good about really that whole workflow. So, yeah, the new user growth continues to be our primary focus, and when you add in everything we're doing with Express, again, like I said, we're off to the races, and we feel very good about the momentum on new user acquisition and existing member retention. And, Greg, as you're aware, I mean, certainly with Express, we also have the model of, you know, customer acquisition as it relates to people coming in through trial and free and then conversion. So we are seeing, you know, the interest level as it relates to express in particular, you know, significant interest. And Shantidhu, since you also called out the strength in digital earlier, including driving new creative all-app subscriptions from your website, are you doing anything different that's helping to drive that behavior? And if so, is that something you think can continue as well? You know, I would, Greg, in sort of modesty, say we've been world-class at, you know, sort of driving that for a long time now. But the team, I think, continues to do an amazing job. And I would say, David referred to the D-DOM. You know, Adobe Home is now sort of increasingly the way that we're driving a lot of, you know, people to get aware of our new products. And so... I would say the mobile part as well and the mobile journeys as we've got these mobile products, whether it's Lightroom or whether it's, you know, certainly Express. That's an area of increasing focus for us. And, you know, the traditional. sort of understanding where search terms are. I think we're getting better and better at that, which leads to way more digital traffic for us. So I think it's across the board. But I'd also highlight, I mean, the commerce team that we have at Adobe that understands, you know, what the segments are and how for those particular segments we can attract people, that's great. I mean, I think in the prepared remarks, Dan also talked about the strength in emerging markets. And, you know, I think the beautiful part about AI is that since they need access to the cloud to get, you know, all of the AI functionality, emerging market growth has been really strong for us. Very helpful. Thank you. And moving on to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Thank you guys for taking the question. And again, congratulations on a really solid set of results and an environment where not very many software companies have been able to beat and raise in this type of uneven environment. I wanted to maybe focus in a little bit on the question that Mark Mordler asked, in particular on what gives you guys the confidence to see a return to year-on-year growth in Creative Cloud Net New ARR. It declined in Q2, declined in Q1, and if I'm not mistaken, declining in Q2 was a little bit steeper than what we saw in Q1. So what are the particular drivers and maybe some detail on those drivers that give you guys the confidence that that trend line that has been actually heading in the wrong direction is going to head in the right direction now. We're actually going to see growth in those metrics in Q3 and Q4. Yeah, thanks, Keith. This is one of the areas that I think we've shared with you, the complexity of the year-over-year comparisons in the first half based on prior pricing marks that we had. But more importantly, to your point, the year-over-year complexities are now behind us, and we're very excited about the momentum of the first half and how it sets us up for the second half. Frankly, across both Document Cloud and Creative Cloud, both are really momentum stories You know, the 478, 487, sorry, just to be clear, the 487 that we printed this time is obviously strong performance, and it implies that both CC and DC came in over what the growth, the guide would have implied otherwise, right? So it's giving us a lot of good momentum going into the back half. Now, the momentum is really driven by three things, and just I'll try to share a little bit more context here and hopefully gives you. First is new user acquisitions. We're seeing Express starting to perform well in terms of bringing a lot of new users into the franchise across mobile and web. AI Assistant and Reader has been a really nice start for us, and we've been very pleased with how the uptake on that's going. And then Firefly itself, as I mentioned, has been increasingly more productive in terms of bringing in onboarding users and then retaining users because of the growth. As we drive that more holistically throughout the product set, we start to see more people using it, including, as Shantanu mentioned earlier, in emerging markets. So we are seeing very good strength and usage in emerging markets, and that has certainly been a bright spot for us, which is something that Obviously represents a lot of potential and upside for us. In terms of existing customers, the migration has been going very well for us as well. So more people are moving to the higher price, higher value plans. Because of the Firefly capabilities, we're even seeing this in enterprises where people are moving up to the highest versions of Creative Cloud, which is what we call Creative Cloud Enterprise 4, because they get more access to features beyond just generation. They have more collaborative capabilities beyond just kind of sharing via email. And we're starting to see that create a nice momentum and upgrade cycles in the enterprise segment as well. And then certainly let's not forget the new offerings too. While still early, automation and content production is something that we're driving effectively in a lot of these accounts with Firefly services. So that mix of new users, existing user migration, and also the new offerings that we have in market are driving that growth formula that we talked about, which is now P times Q plus V for value with these automation services. It is a great answer. Thank you so much. And we have a question from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the generative credit component to your pricing here. It seems like with all the progress you've made embedding Firefly across the key flagship products in the engagement levels that you're seeing, we should start to see perhaps some ramp in that generative credit component to your pricing. Is that a fair assessment? Would you expect to start to see that coming in? Or should we look to other services like the video capabilities that you're going to be launching shortly as a key catalyst there? Thank you. I think you're right, Brad. When we think about what we've done with imaging and video, we've done the right thing by making sure the higher value paid plans that people don't have to think about the amount of generative capability. And so they're you know, the balance between for free and trialist users, they're going to run into the generative capability limits and therefore have to subscribe. But for the people who actually have imaging and vector needs, that they're not constantly thinking about generative, I think we actually got it right. To your point, as we move to video, expect to see different plans because those plans will, you know, by necessity take into account, you know, the amount of work that's required to do video generation. So you're absolutely right as a, you know, sort of framework for you to think about it. The two other things that I would say is, I mean, clearly Express is really being driven by sort of the need for AI and how people are able to describe what they want and get the final output. You know, when David talked about exports, just to clarify what that means is people who have successfully exported got what they want to get done done and that's you know a key measure of how we are doing it and ai is certainly facilitating and accelerating that and last thing i would say brad is as you know on the acrobat side it's a slightly different model which we like which is anybody who has reader and is looking at a document they can have an upsell to the ai assistant if you have acrobat pro you can upsell to the ai assistant And if you're a brand-new acquisition of a user, when you're coming in, you know, the adoption of the highest-value product, so between standard pro and pro plus assistant, we've been pleased to see how many people are migrating to the pro plus assistant. So hopefully that gives you some color of how we think about it differently by product. Very helpful. Thank you, Shantanu. And we'll take a question from Brad Zelmick with Deutsche Bank. Great. Thank you so much, and congrats to all of you. I don't want Anil to feel left out, so I'm going to ask a DX question. Anil, it's good to hear AEP is on track to become the next billion-dollar business for Adobe. Can you expand on the journey and drivers that get you there? And in particular, how important are cloud migrations, and how do you see AEP AI Assistant perhaps accelerating the journey to a billion? Thanks. Thanks. Thank you, Brad. I appreciate it. As you know, I mean, customer experience management and especially it's been a hugely important priority area for chief marketing officers and with CIOs and chief digital officers as well. And for us, since we are focused on personalization scale, which is really built around the AAP platform, We're the largest provider in this space, and we're growing faster than any of our peers, and we're the number one digital experience platform as a result. And that has really helped us keep the momentum. When you think about the AAPI Assistant, it's doing a couple of things. One, it's really making it easier for customers to deploy use cases. When you think of use cases that they have around, for example, generating audiences and running campaigns around those audiences, These are things today that require some data engineering. They require the ability to put these audiences together. So they require marketing and IT teams to work together. The API assistant is making it much easier for marketers to be able to do it themselves and be able to deploy a lot more use cases. So as there's more usage, it'll help drive more consumption and help drive growth in terms of number of profiles, number of users, and we see it helping us grow towards that billion dollar business. Great to hear, and keep up the great work, guys. Thanks. Hey, Operator, we're almost at the top of the hour. We'll take two last questions and then wrap up. Thanks. Thank you. We'll take a question from Cash Rankin with Goldman Sachs. Hi, thank you very much. You guys could have three separate earnings calls because you have three different businesses. Even the smallest one is very large. So, yeah, sorry, Anil, Dave, and Shantanu. I may not be able to ask all the questions that I want. I'm sure we have plenty. But I'll just keep it super high-level, Shantanu. Generative AI, it seems to swing back and forth just so early in its evolution. The possibilities seem magical sometimes, endless sometimes. Sometimes it feels very disappointing. But with every quarter that Adobe is executing on this path, Where do you stand with the question that we do get from investors? Will generative AI be so good that it's the end of the creative process? So we don't need creative folks. The software will do everything. That sounds a little far-fetched, but I'm just throwing it out there to see how you would react to that proposition. Same in the Experience Cloud as well. Could generative AI create its own marketing campaign, put marketing people out of business, Or maybe it doesn't. I'm sure you have strong views. Maybe flipped on the other side, it does create category growth, on the other hand, not category compression. So sorry for that super high-level question, but that seems to be a big debate on the stock here, at least from the long-term perspective. Thank you so much. Yeah, Kash, I think there are two things when we talk to investors that are perhaps on their mind. I mean, I think the first is it's fair to say that the interest that exists right now from investors as it relates to AI is all associated with the infrastructure and chips, and perhaps rightly so, because that's where everybody is creating these models. They're all trying to train them, and there's a lot of, I think, deserved excitement associated with that part of where we are in the evolution of generative AI. If the value of AI doesn't turn to inference and how people are going to use it, then I would say all of that investment would not really reap the benefit in terms of where people are spending the money. And so we're always convinced that when you have this kind of disruptive technology, the real benefits come when people use interfaces to do whatever task they want to do quicker, faster. and when it's embedded into the workflows that they're accustomed to because then there isn't an inertia associated with using it. So, you know, with that sort of as a broad segment, I am a big believer that generative AI is going to, for all the categories that we're in, it's actually going to dramatically expand the market because it's going to make our products more accessible, more affordable, more productive in terms of what we can do. I'm still... acting CMO at the company, and I see the excitement around how we can, with agility, create way more content, create variations. When Anil talked about personalization at scale, I think there are two aspects to it, right? I mean, the first was always data, and Anil and the team have done a great job with sort of the real-time customer data platform to get that, and that's hydrated with users. But the real value is when you infuse that with the right content to make that personalized experience. So I think the demand is there for way more content than people can do, and generative AI is going to be, you know, an accelerant in that as well. And so, you know, net-net, I am absolutely betting on the fact that, you know, five years from now, there'll be more people saying, I'm using creative tools to accomplish what I want, and there'll be more marketers saying, I can now, with the agility that I need, truly deliver a marketing campaign and an audience that's incredibly more specific than I could in the past. And that's Adobe's job, to demonstrate how we are both leading in both those categories and to continue to innovate. But I recognize and I understand the question that exists in the industry associated with AI. If the value doesn't accrue to interfaces, I'll leave you with that. I think the investment would not be as beneficial as I believe it can be. And maybe one thing to add to that, Kash, just to build on what Shantanu was talking about, I think the other thing we get asked a fair amount is about the comparison between different models, right? So Firefly might be better at something. MidJourney might be something at something else. You know, DALI might do something else. And the key thing here is that around this table, we get excited when models innovate. We get excited when Firefly does something amazing. We get excited when third-party models do something because our view, to Shantanu's point, is that the more content that gets generated out of these models, the more content that needs to be edited, whether it's color correction, tone matching, transitions, assembling clips, or masking and compositing images. And the reason for this is that this is not a game where there's going to be one model. Each model is going to have its own personality, what it generates, what it looks like, how fast it generates, how much it costs when it generates that, and to have some interface layer to help synthesize all of this is important. And so just sort of to note, we've said this before, but I'll say it again here, you will see us building our products and tools and services leveraging Firefly for sure. but you'll also see us leveraging best-of-breed personalities from different models and integrate them all together. Awesome. The message here is that Gen AI is going to create more growth in the category, and Shantanu, you did that with the Pivot to Cloud. You grew the category, so here we go again. Thank you so much. Thanks, Kev. And next will be Jake Weber with William Blair. Hey, thanks for taking the questions, and I'll echo my congrats on the great quarter. I know it's early, but what's been the feedback and customer behavior for those users that are on Firefly services and Gen Studio? And then thinking more longer term, what type of price uplifts could you see from those customers over time, just given what you said about the acceleration and Firefly generations being driven by those products? Thanks. Maybe I'll start with customer zero. Right before this meeting, I was in a meeting with our CMO. And sometimes it's hard to tell if he's wearing the CMO or CEO hat, but CMO this time. And we were reviewing a full funnel campaign that we're planning on launching later this year. And exactly as Shantanu mentioned earlier, we saw benefits in terms of cost of the campaign, faster time to market for the campaign. and the amount of content that we can create to personalize that campaign. And that is one of those things that we've been doing more and more around our D-DOM, which has actually been very productive for us, as you can see this quarter, and what we're pitching to other customers. So we've been working with a – we listed some of the customers earlier, but we've been working with a long list of customers on everything from accelerating the content creation for socials accelerating content creation for regional, and then increasing the amount of content that's created for increased personalization, which then, of course, flows into all of the Experience Cloud products that Anil's working on to get targeted better. And Jake, maybe in terms of what I would say we're seeing usage of, I think the initial usage of Firefly services in most companies was all around ideation. How can they create multiple variations of them and, you know, in the ideation process really just accelerate that ideation process? Most companies are then starting with as they're putting it into production, how can they with the brand assets and the brand guidelines that they have do this in terms of the variations, whether they be geographic variations or they be just variations. I mean, if you take a step back also, every single ad company right now will tell you that the more variants that you provide, the better your chances are of appropriately getting an uplift for your media spend. So I would say that most companies are starting with creating these variations for geographies. The other one that we see a fair amount of is engaging with their communities. So when they want their communities to have assets that they have blessed for usage within community campaigns, that's the other place where Firefly services are being used and a company has a community portal where the community can come in. take something and then post whether it's on whatever social media site that you want. So I think that's the initial one. All of the agency companies are companies that have actually even publicly said how Gen Studio is something that they have embraced. But even the large media companies, because the media companies are certainly interested in understanding how all of this Gen AI could be used to automate as well as accelerate the amount of content that they can produce. So Hopefully that gives you some color of it. If there's been sort of the questions that they ask along the way, which hopefully and actually luckily we have great answers, it's all around the indemnification and how they can use it. And I would say that continues to be a really key differentiator for us. But since that is the last question, let me just say I'm proud of how we executed in Q2, both across the product innovation delivery as well as you know, the go-to market because clearly a number of you asked, you know, how we were able to put together these numbers where others have perhaps talked about the macroeconomic environment. We certainly remain focused on leveraging technology to delight a broader set of customers. And at the end of the day, to the questions that we were asked, we believe that the real value of AI will be in the interfaces that individuals, enterprises use to accomplish their tasks and workflows. And we think we're incredibly well positioned. So thank you for joining us. Thanks, everyone. This concludes the call. Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and have an excellent day.
