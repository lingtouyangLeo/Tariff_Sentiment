With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Powell Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir. Thanks, Norma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call. Q1 proved to be another strong quarter. where we delivered excellent top and bottom line growth. Our team did an outstanding job of winning more net new business again this quarter. I'll provide some high level comments on our performance along with updates on the insurance market and the M&A landscape. Then Andy will discuss our financials in more detail. Lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments, some closing thoughts and comments before we open up to Q&A. Now let's get into our results for the quarter. I'm on slide four. We delivered over $1.25 billion of revenue, growing 12.7% in total and 8.6 organically over the first quarter of 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 130 basis points to 37%, and our adjusted earnings per share grew 18.8% to $1.14. On the M&A front, we completed six acquisitions with estimated annual revenue of $16 million. I'm on slide five. Growth in markets we operate in has not materially changed compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as consumer spending remained resilient. Levels of hiring and investment were similar to what we experienced in the second half of 23. However, there continues to be a shortage of workers for many industries, which has also driven elevated levels of inflation. From an insurance pricing standpoint, the overall changes in rates for most lines were relatively consistent, with the fourth quarter of last year. Pricing for employee benefits was similar to prior quarters, with medical and pharmacy costs up 7% to 9%. These pressures are driving strong demand for our EV consulting businesses. Rates in the admitted P&C markets were up 5% to 10% for most lines, while we continue to see decreases of 5% to 10% for workers' compensation in most states. However, we're starting to see some changes in rates for casualty professional lines, and cat property as compared to prior quarters. Due to ongoing levels of inflation and the size of legal judgments, pricing for excess casualty lines continues to increase, and we're seeing upward pressure for primary limits. Over the majority of my career, primary liability rates seem to have been under downward pressure. As you've seen, the excess market has been up substantially in the past few years, And with the continued deterioration in the general liability market, the primary rates seem to be moving up in certain lines of business. Now, it seems there is an upward pressure on both primary and excess rates. For professional liability, we saw a slight improvement in pricing as compared to last quarter, but rates are still flat to down 10%. Cat property rates moderated during the quarter as compared to 2023. We saw many accounts that had low or no losses with rates down 10% or more. And accounts with losses or poor construction or a combination of both increased slightly to up 15%. This was driven by some carriers or facilities willing to put up additional limits combined with some new capital entering the marketplace. As we've seen some downward rate pressure on certain properties, This may have a slight impact on those offices in CAT areas. However, their new business activity remains strong and they're performing well. As we've always said, our organic growth in a steady state economy is generally driven two-thirds by exposure units and one-third by rate. In CAT-prone areas, the rate impact might be slightly higher. Keep in mind, we've built a highly diversified company in geography, lines of coverage, and customer size as these enable our consistently strong financial performance. Lastly, in the M&A marketplace, it continued to be competitive for high-quality businesses. For the quarter, we remained active, building relationships with many companies and acquiring another six. I'm on slide six. Let's transition to the performance of our three segments. Retail delivered another great quarter with organic growth of 7.2%, winning a lot of new customers along with good retention. In addition, all lines of business performed well. We're very pleased how the team is leveraging our collective capabilities in order to create unique solutions for our customers. Our goal has always been to have the tools and capabilities to serve our customers as they grow and become more complex. We have strategically built our employee benefits and property and casualty businesses to serve customers of all sizes, those with less than 50 to over 50,000 lives, as well as startups to multibillion-dollar revenue companies. The program segment had an outstanding quarter, delivering organic growth of 11.8%. This is even with the headwinds of $8 million of flood claims processing revenue we recognized in the first quarter of last year. Our highly diversified global portfolio of over 60 programs performed very well for the quarter as we continue to provide market differentiated solutions that enable us to bind more accounts. Wholesale brokerage delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 10.8%. This growth was primarily driven by binding more net new business and rate increases. Our highly diversified lines of business, including open brokerage, delegated authority, and personalized grew very well during the quarter. Now I'll turn it over to Andy to get into more details regarding our financial results. Right, thank you, pal. Good morning, everybody. We're over on slide number seven. I'll review our financial results in additional detail. When we refer to EBITDAQ, EBITDAQ margin, income before income taxes, or diluted net income per share, we're referring to those measures on an adjusted basis which now reflect the previously announced exclusion of intangible asset amortization. The reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found either in the appendix of this presentation or in the press release we issued yesterday. We delivered total revenues of $1,258,000,000, growing 12.7% as compared to the first quarter in the prior year. Income before income taxes increased by 19.4%. and EBITDA grew by 17.1%. Our EBITDA margin was 37%, expanding by an impressive 130 basis points over the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the quarter was down slightly from the prior year, with diluted net income per share increasing by 18.8% from last year to $1.14. Our weighted average shares outstanding increased a little over 1% as we continue to prioritize paying down debt on a full year basis, as this has a higher contribution to earnings per share, cash flow, and shareholder value. Lastly, our dividends per share paid increased by 13% as compared to the first quarter of last year. Overall, it was a very strong quarter. We're on slide number eight. The retail segment grew total revenues by 10%. with organic growth of 7.2%. The difference between total revenues and organic revenue was driven by acquisition activity over the past year. EBITDA grew slightly slower than total revenues due primarily to higher non-cash stock-based compensation costs as well as lower contingent commissions. We're on slide number nine. Programs had another strong quarter, with total revenues growing 16.9% and organic growth of 11.8%. The incremental growth in total revenues and excess of organic was driven primarily by increased contingent commissions due to our strong underwriting performance and a quiet hurricane season in 2023. The growth in contingent commissions included approximately $7 million related to finalizing prior year estimates that we do not expect to recur in the first quarter of next year. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 580 basis points to 42.3%. driven by the leveraging of our expense base, higher contingents, and the sale of certain claims processing businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023. We're over on slide number 10. Our wholesale brokerage segment delivered another great quarter with total revenue growth of 15.4% and organic growth of 10.8%. The incremental growth in total revenues in excess of organic was driven by higher contingent commissions and acquisitions completed over the last 12 months. Our EBITDA margin increased by 150 basis points to 32.4% due to leveraging our expense base and higher contingent commissions. A few comments regarding cash generation and capital allocation. From a cash flow perspective, our first quarter is normally the lowest of the year. In addition, for this year, our cash flow from operations was impacted by paying two quarters of federal income taxes for 2023 that were permitted to be deferred as part of Hurricane Adelia tax relief and the payment of income taxes associated with the gain on the sale of certain businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. We're continuing to expect another strong year of cash generation and a conversion ratio of cash flow from operations to revenues in the range of 22 to 24%. Lastly, we ended the quarter with approximately 580 million of operating cash and are in a strong capital position. With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments. Thanks, Andy. Great report. From an economic standpoint, we expect growth to continue this year. As we've mentioned before, we do think this expansion will moderate towards more normal levels over the coming quarters. With persistent inflation and a tight labor market, we believe there's a good backdrop that will drive growth, hiring, and investment for many businesses. Regarding the admitted markets, we believe overall rate changes will remain relatively similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. For the ENS markets, rate decreases for professional lines should continue to moderate as we expect casualty, both primary and excess, to further increase. Based on what we see today, we believe there will be continued rate pressure for cap property. This is highly dependent on early storm activity this year. Regarding M&A, we're in a great position with a strong balance sheet and access to capital. We continue to talk to a lot of companies and build relationships. Our disciplined approach has proven to be very successful as we're focused on acquiring high-quality organizations that fit culturally. We have great momentum coming out of the first quarter. There's good economic outlook, and our team continues to win more net new business by leveraging our collective capabilities. This positions us to deliver another year of industry-leading financial results. With that, we'll turn it back over to Norma to open the lines for Q&A. Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. Please wait for your name to be announced. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question until all have had a chance to ask a question, after which we will answer any additional questions from you as time permits. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. One moment for our first question, please. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hey, thanks. Maybe just firstly on the margins, I was curious if the margin breakdown this quarter was kind of how you envision this year playing out with national programs leading the way. And is it right to think that divesting the claims processing businesses in the fourth quarter created sustainable margin improvement in national programs that should flow through to coming quarters? Hey, good morning, Rob. It's Andy here. I think, you know, as we've talked about in the past, you know, margins can move around in the segments by individual quarters. I think overall we're extremely pleased with the performance for the first quarter. There will probably be ups and downs over the quarters. You know, as an example, I know we've talked about in the past, third quarter we normally will budget for, you know, a storm and a half. You never know how exactly that's going to turn out. So that kind of moves things back around. And then at least for this year on the sale of some of those services businesses is, yes, year over year we'll see an increase in the margin from that disposal. Okay, great. Thanks. And then just In regard to the pricing moderation in property CAD, I'm just trying to wrap our heads around if increased demand for coverage could offset some of the pricing declines and kind of the magnitude of each of those factors and how that could play out for brown and brown organic growth in 2Q and beyond. So, Rob, what I would say is this. Um, we, and I actually thought that we would be at this place a little sooner in the cycle than today. So I thought we might've been here a year ago or, you know, uh, somewhere between a year ago and today. So what are you seeing? And let me describe that. And then I'll answer your question. Number one, remember, most buyers of insurance have what I call pricing fatigue. So if you have gotten a price increase on your condo or your properties or whatever for the past four or five years, you're just over it. That's the first thing. The second thing is sometimes, even though you do the very best you can as the broker, sometimes the client shoots the messenger because they're just so frustrated with the marketplace. Having said that, what you're finding today is people that wrote a $10 million primary are giving you $20 or $25 million in Now, and that's bumping out several of those buffer layers. So you're going to have downward pressure on the overall program. So you have several scenarios that could occur. One, yes, you could buy more limits, although my instinct would be because of the pricing fatigue, they would probably not buy more limits right now. Excuse me. Number two, they might be able to get slightly better terms and conditions, which would be good. And three, in the event that we don't have another storm this year sometime, that pricing pressure downward will continue. That said, and we've always said in ENS, in our wholesale business and in our retail business, We actually write a lot of business when the market is going up and when the market is going down. Usually you don't see as much in that market, the ENS market, when the rates are flat, which they're relatively never flat. That's the answer. Excuse me. Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks, Rob. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Great. Good morning, everyone. So I would like to... Powell, in your comments, you talked about different rate movements, and then you mentioned this two-thirds to one-third ratio. I guess I'm trying to reconcile the downward pressure or moderating upward pressure in some of the lines of business. Can you give us a perspective on... Like how much of your total business is excess and surplus lines? How much is property? How much is excess casualty? Just so we can sort of gauge the moving pieces. Well, Greg, it's nice to talk to you this morning, and thank you for the question. I know you know the answer to this, but we don't give that level of detail out. However, what I would say is this. We write lots of cat property in all cat-prone states, but we don't write it all exclusively from the cat-prone states. You could have an office that is in Chicago or Minneapolis or Milwaukee that writes business in these areas as well. That's number one. Number two, from a casualty standpoint, think about We write an enormous amount in our retail business of package business. And in that package business, property many times is not the biggest part of the account. The largest account many times is workers' compensation followed by either auto or general liability. So I know I didn't answer your question, but I'm just trying to give you a little color on our book in small, medium, upper middle market, and even large accounts. And so you're going to have a certain segment in the large accounts that are going to not be as affected up or down because if they're on fees. But what I would say is we are very focused on delivering very, very competitive programs for our customers and and that's that is in many instances going to have downward pressure on our property book there is some offset i'm not going to say it's one for one but there is some offset with this pressure in the casualty areas and the moderation professional liability rates going down okay greg if hey greg just on this i mean we've talked about it we start you know last year uh going through a few different times and then we've been over on other calls i think the reason why you know we we mention a lot about diversification in the business is well we do write a lot of cat property we write a lot of non-cap property we write a lot of other lines we're across multiple industries geographies so we don't we don't have this major concentration in any area which we think is a really good thing for our business because If one thing could be up, something else could be down. It puts a nice ballast across the organization. Right, makes sense. I guess as a follow-up, Andy, I think in your prepared comments, you called out a one-time benefit in the program side. Can you quantify that again? You were going through this quickly, so I didn't catch all the detail. Sure, yeah, no problem. What we had called out was we said, About 7 million of the contingent commissions that we recorded in the first quarter were related to finalizing the estimates that we recorded last year. So we would not expect to see that in Q1 of next year. So just keep that in mind for modeling purposes next year. Got it. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Hey, morning. Thanks. Back to the contingents. And, you know, we could take this offline if you think it's warranted. But if we take out the $7 million, contingents were still much better than I feel like you've kind of directionally guided to, although the guide, I believe, is for a full year. So I'm just trying to get at is there – Was there, is there seasonality or a pull forward on your, in one queue that we should be cognizant of when we think about the next three quarters of the year? Or is there kind of a change in your view now, X to 7 million of your view on contingents for the year? Yeah. Hey, good morning, Mike. No, I wouldn't say that there was any pull forward in any nature. So, you know, timing or anything of that nature. When we record the contingent commissions based upon, the policies that we place to the written premium that's out there. And we estimate those to the best knowledge that we have at the time on what we believe the profitability of the book will be. So that's why there's always going to be some sort of adjustments up and down to the, uh, to the estimates. I think as we went into the, uh, the year, we thought that they would probably be flat up a little bit. They'll probably be now with the first quarter looks like qualifying potentially for a little bit more than what we had before, which is good for us for the year. And then there's always the question of kind of what happens during storm season. That's always kind of the wild card that may adjust the calculations. Okay, that's helpful. Lastly, switching gears to cash flow as a percentage of revenues, you know, loud and clear about the 22 to 24 guide still in your term. I believe in the past, not too distant past, you talked about a higher percentage figure closer to 25 being normal. Can you walk us through quickly, you know, what, what's, why lower today and, and whether there, you know, we, I guess we can figure out whether it could go back higher to a higher level over time, depending on the, on the, what's keeping it down today. Yeah. So Mike, the, so your first question is, and I think what we said in the past is We think that the business kind of over a medium term, medium to long term, has a conversion ratio of cash flow from ops somewhere around 24% to 26%. We still feel really good with that range for the organization. It's come down over the last year and a half, two years, primarily associated with the higher interest expense. But as we're now kind of making that lap and you can see the impact on cash flow from interest expense for the quarter, right, it was minimal there. The main thing impacting this year was really the incremental taxes that we talked about. So if you take those and kind of isolate that in your projections, you'd see we're actually back pretty close to our normal rate this year. So we feel really comfortable, depending upon what happens with interest rates or if we take on any incremental debt for acquisitions or whatever, that there's a pretty clear path back to that by next year. Helpful. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Thank you. Good morning. You had mentioned the employee benefits medical pharmacy up 7% to 9%. Was the organic in benefits comparable to the overall organic number, or was it a little bit faster in benefits, a little bit slower? Once again, we don't usually break out, as you know, the specifics on P&C and benefits, but I would tell you we're very pleased with the way our benefits business is growing organically and the capabilities that we've built over the last 10 years there. We're able, Mark, to compete on basically any size account here domestically. It could have 100,000 lives. It could have 100 lives. And so we're very pleased with how that business is performing. Thank you for that. And then the wholesale open brokerage, any observations there about the growth profile on that business, kind of this quarter versus last quarter? And are you still seeing the mixed shift into excess and surplus, or has that stabilized? How do you see that? Yeah, I think the short answer to that is yes, we continue to still see accounts coming in to the ENS marketplace. That's number one. Number two, I would say that, you know, to my earlier comments, any time the rates are going up, or going down, there is an opportunity to write a lot of new business. Having said that, there also is sort of a reset in the market. So I'm going to use my term is sort of, I'm not going to say chaos, but it's a little bit chaotic in terms of who will do what and how do you get to additional limits or some markets will put out more limits. And so you've had a lot of, you know, very strong results in some carriers domestically and overseas. And those carriers or marketplaces will want to play in the cat property market. So I would say that it creates a lot of opportunity for us, but don't lose sight of the fact that, you know, I made the comment when you have five years of increasing rates, Sometimes we, as the messenger, get shot in the process. Now, that works both ways. We pick up a lot of business that way, but we also are subject to lose business that way because the buyer is just, you know, tired. Understood. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mark. Our next question comes from the line of Elise Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, you guys have continued to post pretty strong organic growth within the program segment. I know you guys pointed out, I think, Powell, it was you that you guys lapped some one-off revenue last Q1, so can you just dive into a little bit more details on what's driving the really strong growth there, and should we expect that to persist throughout the rest of the year? And I guess I'm looking more kind of away just from some of the revenue from the captive, just in the programs, you know, the traditional programs, X the captive business. Okay, so good morning, Elise, and glad that you recognize that strong performance in programs today. We appreciate that. Number one, remember inside of programs we have several programs that have either significant wind exposure, that would be cat property, or earthquake exposure. So that's not really a cat event, but it is an area where there is more competition. So what I would tell you is we do think that there are good growth opportunities for us going forward in programs. We, as we said last quarter, we have moderated those slightly just because we are starting to see more entrants, i.e. in the ENS space, on wind, so cat wind, and we're starting to see some more competitors in Quake. That said, we feel really good about the programs business, as you know. And we think about it very long term. So the performance of our underwriting facilities have delivered really good results for our carrier partners. And so what we find is more and more carrier partners want to come and join our facilities. That doesn't mean that we can put them all in those facilities, but I'm just saying there continues to be a great deal of interest. And I would remind you and everyone else, only 12 short years ago when we bought Arrowhead, there was a feeling that maybe MGAs were not as good as they are today. So you all in the investment community sort of said, hmm, that might be a mistake or you're changing the business or whatever the case may be. And we've been very fortunate. Arrowhead was a very good acquisition and we got a lot of very good leaders out of it. And so we're very pleased, but it is interesting how the tide turns. I would also mention one final thing. We have a lender place business where we do loan processing and things like that. And that business has performed very well in terms of we've written a lot of new business there as well. So I hope that answers your question, Elise. Yeah, thanks. And then my second question is on margin. You know, you guys have said, you know, your guidance last quarter, Andy, I think was slightly up for the full year, obviously started off pretty strong. And it sounds like you're not changing the guidance for contingents, right? Because to a prior question, there was no pull forward. So does it now feel like, you know, margins, you know, you know, should come in, you know, better than expected for the full year. And how should we think about, I know there's some headwinds from captives in the back half as we think about losses, but is there anything else you would point out or can we just think about, I guess, there's, you know, some tailwinds relative to the original margin guide for the full year? Yeah. Hey, good morning, Elise. We still feel really good about the guidance for the full year right now. And I think to your point, you know, the question is what's the potential risk impact and more than likely in the third quarter but could be the fourth quarter of you know storm claim activity so i think with it just being the first quarter is very very pleased with the first quarter um but i think right now we're probably hold was still you know up slightly but feel we feel really good about the year thank you thank you one moment for our next question please our next question comes from the line of jing li With KBW, your line is now open. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just have a question on the program margin. So I know you mentioned it included the sale of the service segment. Is it possible to see what the impact on the margin? Can you put a number on it? Yeah, good morning. is probably the easiest way to do that. If you go back to the 8K that we put out in early March, you can kind of see the impact of the businesses and the businesses that we sold rolled into national programs. That'll give you a pretty easy way to calculate that. Okay. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the retail segment margin. It also contracted a little year over year. Can you please add more color on that? Sure. So, good morning. And I would tell you that, as you know, we don't think one quarter makes a trend. We were very pleased with the organic growth in our retail business and the amount of new business that we are winning on a net new basis. I'll also say that we write business in Q1, and not all the revenue comes in in Q1, as you know, so it comes in over subsequent quarters. So having said that, please don't think one quarter, whether it's up slightly, down slightly, creates a trend. We're trying to improve the business over the long term. That's one year, three years, five years, ten years. And if you look at the performance of our retail business in the last, let's say, three years, we're extremely pleased with not only the organic growth but the margin profile. So we're very bullish on retail, as we have been. And so thank you for the question, but I would say that we're very pleased. And don't take a little up or a little down too far out of context. Got it. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. One moment. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open. Yeah, thank you. Pal, I'm just curious. There's some data out this quarter that showed some stamping data that showed E&S kind of premium slowing in some of the major states. I'm wondering if that's what you're experiencing, seeing that maybe the standard markets are getting a little more of a risk appetite here and the E&S kind of growth rates that we've been seeing are slowing, or maybe we're just misinterpreting that. I think, Brian, I would hold judgment on that. And let me tell you why. Let's just use the state of California for a moment. You read a lot about the state of California and what's going on. There was a large carrier that's a direct rider that has a bunch of folks. I think Caitlin Clark is a spokesperson for who they just had their carrier in the state downgraded to B. And so they are talking about non-renewing 30,000 policies in that state. So the question is, where is it going to go? And the answer is, it may go into the fair plan. which is not the desire of the state. And so, but they may, that may flow into this fair plan, you know, in the near term. Those ultimately may come out of the fair plan and into the ENS market. So there's an example in the state of California. In the state of Florida, as, excuse me, as you probably know, the number of policies in citizens, the state facility, has technically gone down year over year. I think that's a little misleading because what you had is you had a number of depopulation companies come and they allocated those policies to them. So again, in states like California, Florida, as noted, even Texas and others, Louisiana, the insurance commissioners are trying first and foremost to create an environment where there is a competitive environment that actually there is affordability and availability and so i would not read too much into those early indications because the next time that report comes out brian it might say up substantially i don't think it would say up substantially but up so i would just uh hold judgment on that one gotcha and then um specifically on florida Are you seeing any additional capacity come in at this point because of the legislative changes? I think we're hearing a little bit about that. Yeah, so what I would say is the legislative changes, that's going to take time for that fully to bake in. So don't make the assumption that you effectuate law and then all of a sudden immediately the carriers start lining up. It just doesn't work that way. What I would say, though, is on the flip side, as I described, carriers that might provide a $10 million primary limit on a property might actually provide a $20 or a $25 million, and we are seeing that on certain properties in Florida. So technically, I view that as more willingness to write and extend limits which in turn is downward pressure for the buyer the client that's good for the client and so we're seeing some of that it is not all downward i do not want anybody to come away from this call saying hey every piece of property is going down that is not the case if you if you talk to our senior leaders and leaders in florida in our retail business And he said, what's happening in property, depending on the line or the type of business, they might say it's down in condos. It might be up overall slightly with all properties. But there are just very, very unique distinctions in there. So think not so much legislative action yet. It's more market action. Thank you for the answers. Yep. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Hi, everyone. Looking at the contingent commissions and national programs for the past couple of quarters, even taking out the non-recurring benefit this quarter, there's been some pretty significant growth I was hoping y'all could help us kind of frame that across underlying growth in the business versus maybe improvements in underwriting performance versus just the contribution from the relatively low storm activity last year, just to kind of help us think about how that might look going forward and what sort of growth rate we should assume. Good morning, Grace. As we mentioned in our comments, our prepared remarks, really driven off of, you know, both of those factors that are out there. We think we deliver some of the best underwriting results for our carrier partners in the industry. And so that's reflective of the contingent commissions that we're able to participate in. And then with the lower storm activity last year, that is providing for At least incremental also this year again We'll kind of see what happens as we get through the through the storm season and then you've got some which is just based upon the growth in the business the one thing to keep in mind is Programs is very different than if you look at retail and the retail generally kind of trends right along with the growth and commissions and fees you can see, you know ups and downs within programs and that you wouldn't get the same correlation in some of the other divisions just because we may qualify for a program or qualify for contingent commissions for one program one year and another not inside of there. So you may see a little bit more volatility, okay? Okay, thank you. And I guess thinking about the interest rate environment, it seems like rates might be staying a bit higher for longer relative to what a lot of economists thought at the beginning of the year. I know that you all said that the competition for M&A had stayed pretty steady so far this year, but just as some of your competitors that have historically been a bit more sensitive to interest rates when considering deal activity just kind of come to the realization that rates might be higher for longer, do you expect any sort of changes to the environment when looking at deals for the remainder of the year or everything should stay pretty steady? Thanks. So, Grace, this is Powell. I would say that we think that it will continue to be a very competitive environment from M&A. Having said that, there are certain firms that are more short-term in nature that are highly leveraged that would be more sensitive to interest rates, and we may see one or some of them not be as active for a period of time because of their debt load. Having said that, there seem to be plenty other shorter term firms that are based on leverage that seem to be active as well. So I don't want you to get the impression that the higher interest rate environment is going to dramatically change the level of competition. that might change the names of the participants, but not the number or how competitive it is. We haven't seen that. Hey, Grace, I want to come back to one other thing just on the contingent. I know we talked about programs. Just other thing, keep in mind in retail, and you saw it in the numbers and everything, contingents were down in the retail business and year over year, about $1.4 million or so. And we've had downward pressure on the contingency we earn within personal lines, just based upon overall profitability within personal lines in just that sector right now. We would expect that to probably continue on for this year. So you can just kind of keep that in mind as you're looking at trending on also on retail, okay? Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Heliniak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Yes, good morning. There's some data out showing M&A was slower for the industry in Q1. And just wondering, I know you talked about just a minute ago, what you're seeing, your pipeline and outlook there for 2024 as specific to you because you're M&A has held up pretty well in 2023. Just any thoughts there? Sure. Scott, I want you to, again, don't draw too many conclusions from one quarter or even six months. Acquisitions are not linear, as you know, and when and why people sell is different. And so we are always talking to people to want to be at the table when and if, but it's usually when they decide to sell. And so we believe it's all about cultural fit. And obviously, it has to make sense financially for both parties. But usually in these competitions, when we are talking to someone, it becomes very obvious in the process that there may be one cultural fit, whether that's us or not, maybe it may not be us that fits with that seller. And then many times that is who they do a transaction with, not exclusively, but many times. And so when I say that, I would tell you that, you know, you'll laugh when I say this, but our pipeline is good. It'll be good next quarter. It'll probably be good next year too. And I'm not trying to be funny. but we got plenty of opportunities. It's just a question of, do they fit culturally and do they make sense financially? And we're not rushing to do something. The one thing that you may know about us is in the investment community, there are three things that they say about Brown and Brown with certainty. Number one, we pay with cash. It's hard to argue with greenbacks. Number two, When we give someone a term sheet, that is not a license to renegotiate after due diligence like some others. So we do what we say and say what we do. And three is when we make a decision, we giddy up and go. So those, we believe, are three redeeming factors. But we talk to people and we are trying to make sure that they understand what day two is going to look like. not the, you know, the process of courtship. And so, um, we feel really good about the things that we got going on. We got people talking to people all the time. And I think that there will continue to be an enormous amount of consolidation in our industry in the next three to seven years. And we are going to be right here able to look at and or participate in a lot of it. Okay. Thanks for the detail. Just, um, The other follow-up I had was just, I know you don't break it out specifically, but anything you can share on organic growth trends outside of the U.S. and just kind of, I'm not looking for a specific number, just anything you can comment on in terms of what you're seeing in Europe and with some of the acquisitions you've closed over the past few years, just any kind of general comment on revenue growth trends you're seeing there. Sure. So Scott, I would say that it is performing in a very similar fashion to our businesses domestically. So we're very pleased with the performance of our businesses overseas. And that's not just Europe. I mean, Canada, I mean, we got a lot of cool stuff going. But we are very pleased. But I would say as a broad statement, think that its performance is very similar to what we see domestically. Great. Appreciate that. Thanks. Yep. Thank you. One moment for our next question. It comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Your line is now open. Thank you, guys. Good morning. Maybe just taking a step back on programs, there's been a lot of discussion around this. Are you able to help us understand the breakout in the strength just between rate versus exposure versus new business? Hey, good morning. Mike Handy here. We don't break out that level of granularity, but we're very pleased with the growth in the business of what we're driving from new business where we are on policy retention and that business as well as the rate mix across all the programs. Again, to Powell's earlier comment, it depends on individual programs. They can be impacted more or less by rate, but we operate 60 programs around the world, and so we're really pleased with the overall mix. But generally, that overall business as well as the others, a lot of ours comes out of net new business as we talked about. Let me mention one other thing, Mike. Just as a broad statement, I know you know this, but remember, we're underwriting on behalf of our carrier partners. So we have this enormous responsibility to try to the best of our ability to write good risks. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. And having said that, The growth that we have enjoyed, albeit quite good, is you've got to understand we are doing our jobs of risk selection. So what I'm trying to say is that is not we write everything that moves. And I know you know that, but I think it's important for everybody to hear that. There is a lot of business that just doesn't fit, and that's okay. And so we would rather show discipline – underwriting on both ends of that spectrum so you know some people and by the way we've grown very nicely but the answer is if we didn't do it the way we've done it it could have grown a lot more but the results longer term for our carrier partners would not have been as good so very important distinction well also on that one mike is um You can do that short term and grow the heck out of it. We also lose the contingents that probably come along with it, and that's an important part of our business because we want to make sure that we're placing good business for our carrier partners. We don't want to go through a carrier change. That's really painful for everybody. So we try to think about these over a longer-term horizon rather than just growing it by a quarter or over four quarters. Got it. Really helpful. Maybe just thinking back to your comments, Powell, around casualty and liability pricing ticking up, just sort of curious your views, like if you think we're kind of in the earlier innings of something, you know, a continued sort of upward trend, or if it seems a little bit more short-term. Well, Mike, it's... As I said, I've only been in the insurance business for 34 years. And in that period of time, it seems most of that time there's been downward pressure on GL rates. And now there is, as you've read and are starting to see, there's more and more adverse development in, you know, the last couple accident years, particularly 19, 18, maybe 20. And so if you talk to our carrier partners more on a philosophical level, not just on an individual risk level, I think there is a feeling that there could be, well, a logical response would be there could and should be some upward pressure on liability rates in the near to intermediate term. That means the next several years. That's what I think the logic and the rational would say. That said, our industry has never been known for being, on the risk-bearing side, totally rational or totally logical. But based on what I've seen, I think we're going to continue to see more upward pressure on excess in umbrellas. And I do think we're going to start to see, you know, it may not be a big bump. I'm not talking about boom, goes north, you know, real fast. But I think we're going to continue to see some upward pressure on general liability, and it's not going to be this year or next year. It could be a couple years. Really helpful. Thank you, Powell. Maybe if I could sneak one specific one just on dealer services. Just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of, like, inventory levels out there and activity in that segment. Hey, Mike. Andy here. is I think what we've seen at least over kind of the last year or so in that range is inventories are back, probably not to where they were, we'll call it pre-COVID, but you can find cars and trucks today and RVs because we also work in that space, which is good. I think you've seen some of the prices for used cars are coming down a little bit that are out there. You've got some sensitivity around interest rates depending upon the profile of the buyer and everything. But, you know, I think our overall customer base is doing well. We're continuing to win more customers in that space and feel good about the outlook in comparison to kind of where we were coming down off of the highs of COVID when, I mean, cars and trucks were just flying off the lots back then. We feel like we've kind of got through that space, so we don't have, at least today, thinking that we've got any head wounds coming at us. Awesome. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks, Mike. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, I'm currently showing no further questions. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Powell-Brown for closing comments. Thanks, Norma, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. I just want to make a couple concluding comments. Um, we are seeing a lot of new business opportunities and capturing those. So I'm very pleased about the amount of new business that we're writing and the net new that that's translating through into our books. Number two, um, change creates opportunity. And so the changes that you've heard today, and I'm specifically thinking about cap property, although it creates some chaos that creates some, some opportunity. And most importantly, It creates benefits for our customers. So I just want to mention that. And three, relative to the acquisition space, you know, we don't have a hard and fast rule of exactly how much we want to buy every year. We have a goal that we'd like to shoot at, but it's always about acquisitions that fit culturally and make sense financially. Do I think there are going to be a lot of opportunities this year? I do. do. I think there will be more next year. I don't know if there are going to be more, but I think there'll be an equal amount. I think there's lots of change ahead in distribution. I think there are lots of firms that are owned, that have private equity backing, that are trying to figure out what the next step is. And so it's going to be an interesting time. I'm not signaling one over the other. That's not what I'm trying to say. But we feel really good about the business. We had a great quarter. We feel really good going into Q2. And we look forward to talking to you next time. Y'all have a nice day, good day, and good luck. Goodbye. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.
