Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Tower fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Following the prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press 1 followed by 0 now. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Adam Smith, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations in FP&A. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, and thank you for joining American Towers' fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks, under the investor relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com. I am joined on the call today by Steve Vondran, our president and CEO, and Rod Smith, our executive vice president, CFO, and treasurer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2025 outlook, capital allocation, and future operating performance, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those that will be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2024, and then other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. When I stepped into the CEO role about a year ago, I expressed my excitement about leading American Tower through its next era of growth and evolution. We have an exceptional portfolio of assets, unmatched operating capabilities, and we're in what I believe to be one of the most durable businesses, catalyzed by ever increasing mobile network demand. Over the past year, activity across our platform has highlighted the criticality of our communications assets in meeting growing demand. As carriers in our U.S. and European markets deployed mid-band spectrum assets, emerging market players identified 4G networks and began rolling out 5G, and our CoreSight data center business delivered yet another record year of new leasing. My original perspective of the 5G cycle requiring continued network investments necessary to support coverage has been realized and bolstered with incremental optimism through the next phase of AI-driven demand, which I believe will benefit our towers and data centers and unlock synergistic value between the two at the edge. Last year, I also laid out a set of strategic priorities centered on balance sheet strength, efficiency, portfolio quality, and capital allocation discipline, all meant to further enhance our customer value proposition and strengthen the durability and quality of earnings for our shareholders over the long term. Certain headwinds in 2024 underscored the importance of these initiatives, which better prepare us to weather challenges like care consolidation and FX and interest rate volatility. And although these global risks persist, Thanks to significant efforts undertaken by the talented members of our global team, we're entering 2025 in a stronger position, and we'll remain focused on pursuing these strategies to prioritize higher quality earnings and sustained growth. We're currently on track to maintain our five times leverage target on a recurring basis this year, which is an acceleration from our initial deleveraging plan following our core site acquisition at the end of 2021. In addition to managing our debt and capital structure, our net leverage profile was further supported by margin expansion, which we've largely driven through systematic reduction of recurring SG&A costs. Cash SG&A, excluding bad debt, reduced by approximately $35 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, supported by various efficiency initiatives, including the thoughtful globalization of company-wide functions like finance, IT, and HR. Most recently, we appointed Bud Null as our Chief Operating Officer, a role that will advance our efforts in driving efficiency and margin expansion by ensuring that we effectively leverage global operating expertise and apply the best of our processes, tools, and capabilities across all of our regions. At the same time, we were happy to further leverage our exceptional bench strength and announce Rich Rossi, who spent over 20 years with American Tower, to lead the US and Canada business. Importantly, with these changes, we aim to further elevate the quality of business functions of customer service and anticipate further enhancing our already attractive margin profile along the way. We'll use the next several months to diligently assess the optimal global operating structure, and in time, we'll communicate long-term efficiency targets. We've already made significant progress, and we have a long runway of opportunities still ahead. Over the past year, we continue to actively manage our global portfolio and forward-looking capital deployment priorities to right-size geographic risk and ensure a strong synergistic fit between our strategy, core competencies, and assets. Most notably, as we discussed on the third quarter call, we exited our India business and have since sold our modest land interest in Australia and New Zealand. We also recently signed an agreement to divest our South Africa fiber business and plan to close that transaction this quarter. We believe the quality of our earnings and growth profile is at a material premium to where we stood only a few years ago. In 2025, we expect our developed markets, which consist of our U.S., Canadian, and European operations, along with core sites, to contribute about 75 percent towards our unlevered AFFO, and we expect to further expand this portion through continued prioritization of capital into these developed segments. We've also increased the proportion of global tower cash flows derived from top operators in each market. Combined with reduced emerging market exposure, this should translate to a more attractive and predictable return profile moving forward. Our stronger portfolio and focused capital allocation plan paired with our best-in-class global operating capabilities and alignment with market leaders better enables us to benefit from positive industry trends. Global demand for mobile data continues to climb. The roughly 35% of mobile data traffic that runs over 5G networks today is expected to increase to 80% by 2030, prompting carriers to enhance and expand their increasingly stressed networks. Currently with 5G upgrades, it improves spectral efficiency, and subsequently with incremental cell sites that will densify their footprints in areas identified as needing additional capacity. In our U.S. tower business, we've observed four quarters of sequential acceleration application activity over the course of 2024, exiting the year with our big three customers having upgraded an average of 65% of their sites within our portfolio with mid-band spectrum, up from just over 50% a year ago. Carriers have begun to highlight the commercial benefits associated with their 5G investments, translated to enhanced network quality, customer retention, and stronger ARPU. with commentary suggesting another active year of network investment in 2025. In fact, although we're between the two peaks of the 5G investment cycle, coverage and capacity, the 2025 outlook for wireless CapEx spend is expected to return to higher levels again, totaling approximately $35 billion, which is roughly $5 billion above the average annual spend during 4G. Now, as Ronald will speak about in a moment, although we anticipate the positive momentum in U.S. activity to continue to 2025, with a solid pipeline supporting it, our outlook for organic tenant buildings growth in the U.S. and Canada steps down modestly compared to 2024. This is a function of the cadence of our contracted use fees and also the commencement timing associated with non-contracted new business, such as new co-locations outside of our MLAs or a customer that may not be under a comprehensive agreement, not a softening in demand. So far, the 5G investment cycle is largely aligned with our expectations. with recent care of commentary, dialogue, and activity further reinforcing our conviction in sustained higher CapEx needs moving forward. Over the next five years, underwritten by projected total mobile network traffic growth of over 15% annually, given the existing service terms, we expect the required network capacity to more than double, with more connected devices, data-intensive applications, and growing uplink transmission requirements, placing significant strain on the networks. Today, we'd expect roughly half of this incremental capacity need to be solved through current spectrum holdings and realized spectral efficiency. That leaves a sizable capacity gap that can only be resolved through densification, additional spectrum coming to market, or a combination of both. In addition, mainstream use of new applications, such as multimodal AI, could further exacerbate capacity shortages and prompt even more activity. Taken all together, we've seen an attractive addressable market that our portfolio is well equipped to accommodate with equipment upgrades, co-locations, and selective new site development over the next several years and beyond. Similar trends generally hold true internationally, where true 5G mid-band coverage continues to progress each year and stands at roughly 45% in Europe, 15% in Latin America, and 10% in Africa. Data consumption has grown at a CAGR of around mid-teens, roughly 20% across these regions since 2020. and we've seen a corresponding increase in cell site density that complements existing site upgrade efforts. Importantly, these mid-band coverage stats illustrate the need for continued investment over the next several years. As we anticipate similar annual data growth across these same geographies, carriers will continue to utilize the most cost-effective ways to bolster their network capacity and coverage, which will include a mix of macro towers, rooftop sites, small cells, and in remote areas where terrestrial networks are not economically efficient, satellites. In our core site business, the team delivered a tremendous quarter of results to round out another exceptional year. These results reinforced the strength of the demand and pricing durability for interconnection-centric, retail-oriented co-location. And while we continue to evaluate Hyperscale, we remain convinced of our core business model and the tangible demand catalysts we see today, including AI-related demand. This allows us to stay disciplined in our lease-up approach to ensure a high-quality customer mix at the right economics, and supports our continued long-term expectation of mid-teens or higher stabilized yields. To build on this momentum in 2025 and beyond and continue to meet the growing needs of our customers across our global platform, we'll maintain the following priorities. First, we continue to evolve our value proposition to our customers and our investment opportunity to our shareholders. I firmly believe that we're the best operator of towers and distributed real estate in the world, which allows us to pass along certain benefits and efficiencies to our customers including powers of service, security and monitoring, data and asset quality, customer service delivery, speed of deployment, and a suite of services capabilities. Additionally, I recognize that investor attraction to American Tower as an equity option requires that we operate the highest quality portfolio with strategic fit among our geographies, demonstrate trustworthy stewardship of shareholder capital through discipline investments, and leverage an operating structure that yields outsized efficiency, margins, and returns. We have an incredibly talented team that lets us do that. And further globalizing our organization will drive additional economies of scale, centralization, and global automation, draw savings across multiple business functions, ensuring that we're able to continue demonstrating synergistic value creation across our 20-plus markets at an exciting time in global connectivity. Next, and as Ron will discuss in more detail, we'll continue to actively manage our capital to prioritize funding of opportunities that yield the most attractive risk-adjusted rates of return over the long term. We'll continue to direct most discretionary capital towards our developed market platforms, including over $600 million for data center development on existing campuses underwritten at mid-teen stabilized yields, with some optionality to pursue smaller tuck-in inorganic opportunities where appropriate, and also the construction of 600 tower sites in Europe, where we anticipate low double-digit day-one yields. At the same time, we're reducing emerging market discretionary capex to just over $300 million in 2025, a reduction of over 60 percent from 2021 and over 15 percent compared to 2024. Spend across our Latin American, African APEC segments will be primarily focused on the construction of about 1,650 previously committed tower sites for strategic customers underwritten at mid-teens day one NOI yields. We expect this number to come down over time as we satisfy those commitments and redirect new discretionary capital to develop regions. In conclusion, macroeconomic uncertainty persists across the global landscape, but consumer demand for connectivity and bandwidth-intensive applications and the associated network requirements remain resilient. The macro tower remains the most cost-effective manner to deliver a gigabyte of mobile data, and our global portfolio of assets and leading capabilities exceptionally equips us to support our customers' multi-year investment needs. Further, we've taken appropriate steps to ensure a higher degree of durable growth and returns generated by our leading business. I'm confident that our focus in operating and actively managing the highest quality global portfolio of assets, offering best-in-class customer service and delivery through our experienced global teams, and leveraging our investment-grade balance sheet positions American Tower to profit from attractive long-term secular demand trends across the wireless and technology industries that drive sustained quality growth and returns for our shareholders over the long term. Now I'll turn it over to Rod to discuss four-year 24 results and our 2025 outlook. Rod? Thanks, Steve, and thank you all for joining the call. We had a strong close to 2024, supported by the execution of our strategic priorities, as Steve highlighted in his remarks. Before I review our 2024 performance, which was in line with prior outlook and expectations for 2025, I'll touch on several highlights from the quarter. First, demand for our assets remained solid. In the U.S., while fixed-use fees in our comprehensive master lease agreements mean that new business growth is somewhat independent of actual carrier activity levels, we were encouraged to see the sequential acceleration in applications continue through Q4. We view this as critical evidence of the importance of mid-band spectrum in our customers' commitment to achieving portfolio coverage. In fact, Q4 volumes more than doubled year over year, reinforcing our conviction that our customers will continue to deploy 5G on their existing sites and densify their networks over the next several years to meet surging data demands. Internationally, Consistent organic new business contributions were complemented by the construction of nearly 1,000 sites with strategic anchor tenants, which includes record volumes in Europe. In our U.S. data center business, demand for our interconnection campuses and associated new leasing remained elevated, resulting in fourth quarter revenue growth of nearly 10 percent. Next, consistent with past quarters, conversion of consolidated cash top line growth was bolstered by vigilant cost management supporting year-over-year cash-adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of over 200 basis points. As I'll touch on in a moment, our focus on driving cost efficiencies across our global business remains a critical priority and evident in our 2025 outlook. Finally, we continue to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheets. In Q4, we opportunistically addressed a portion of our 2025 debt refinancing needs, successfully issuing $1.2 billion in senior unsecured notes at an average coupon of 5.2% and average tenor of 7.5 years. Furthermore, our 2025 plan is in line with our net leverage target. And we begin the year with a strong liquidity position and reduced floating rate debt exposure. providing flexibility and optionality as we address 2025 maturities. Also, in January, we amended and extended our bank facilities with a leading banking syndicate, which improved our applicable margin pricing by 12.5 basis points on drawn debt to 100 basis points, further optimizing our cost of capital. Moving to slide six, I'll first remind you that property revenue and adjusted EBITDA exclude discontinued operations associated with our India sale in both the current and prior year periods. Property revenue growth for the year was nearly 1% and 3% on an FX-neutral basis. Performance was supported by organic tenant billings growth of over 5%, the construction of nearly 2,400 sites, and U.S. data center growth of over 10%. partially offset by a 2% negative headwind associated with a reduction in non-cash straight line revenue. Adjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 2% and over 4% on an FX neutral basis. Growth was negatively impacted by 3.5% associated with a reduction in non-cash straight line. As we have communicated throughout the year, focus on cost management supported a reduction in cash SG&A excluding bad debt, of approximately $35 million as compared to 2023, contributing to cash margin expansion of 140 basis points to 66.8%, demonstrating our commitment to driving efficiency throughout our global organization. Finally, attributable AFFO per share of $10.54 represented nearly 7% growth year-over-year and over 9% on an FX-neutral basis. I'll now summarize a few key points and themes to contextualize our 2025 outlook. First, the drivers supporting our plan are generally consistent with the preliminary indications we provided on our Q3 2024 earnings call. As you'll see on slide seven, solid reoccurring revenue growth with elevated conversion rates to AFFO through strategic global cost management initiatives spanning operating expenses, SG&A maintenance cap backs and cash taxes, fundamentally position our 2025 plan in line with our long-term growth algorithm, partially offset by FX devaluation and interest costs associated with refinancing needs. Although FX and interest rates have proven to be volatile, and unique considerations could move results above or below our mid to high single-digit growth rate target in any given year, We believe our business is positioned to deliver solid, durable, reoccurring AFFO per share growth and attractive returns, and we're committed to actively managing the portfolio to ensure that expectation is achieved. Next, as Steve mentioned, we recently signed an agreement to sell our fiber assets in South Africa, which we assumed to close on March 1st in our outlook, highlighting another step towards enhancing our portfolio quality and focus. Annualized contributions from the South Africa fiber business were approximately $25 million and $20 million in property revenue and adjusted EBITDA, respectively. Turning to slide eight, our 2025 outlook reflects total company organic tenant buildings growth of approximately 5% and around 5.5% absent the impacts of the final tranche of Sprint churn Organic tenant buildings growth in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be greater than or equal to 4.3 percent and greater than or equal to 5.3 percent, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn. A modest reduction compared to 2024 as contracted use fees step down and contributions from non-contracted leasing, which is sensitive to commencement timing, begin to accelerate. Growth includes contributions from organic new business in the mid-3 percent range and a 3% escalator, partially offset by non-sprint related churn and other adjustments of roughly 1%. It's important to note that our guide assumes the first three quarters of 2025 will be impacted by approximately 140 basis points of sprint churn, likely keeping growth below 4% during that time period, before recovering to over 5.5% in Q4, which will not have any negative growth impacts from sprint churn. Growth in Africa and APAC of approximately 12% includes roughly 7% in escalators, 6% in organic new business as ongoing 4G densification and initial 5G upgrades continue, and less than 1% in other billings adjustments, partially offset by approximately 2% in churn, which is a notable improvement from prior years. Growth in Europe of approximately 5% includes 2% in escalators, and steady organic new business contributions of around 4%, partially offset by churn of approximately 1%. In Latin America, growth of approximately 2% includes contributions from escalators of around 5% and organic new business of over 2%. Gross growth is partially offset by another year of carrier consolidation driven churn, which we expect to persist through 2027. resulting in elevated churn of approximately 5 percent in 2025 and other billing adjustments of less than 1 percent. Turning to slide nine, you'll see organic tenant billings is supporting property revenue growth of over 0.5 percent or approximately 3 percent on an FX-neutral basis, which is impacted by a year-over-year FX-neutral reduction of $217 million in straight-line revenue and over 2 percent negative headwind to reported growth. Complementing organic tower growth, net of a reduction due to the non-recurrence of certain one-time revenue benefits in 2024 is a continuation of solid performance in our U.S. data center business, growing at nearly 12% at the midpoint. Moving to slide 10, cash property revenue growth is converting at a high rate to adjusted EBITDA, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 1% and over 3% on an FX neutral basis. which includes an approximately 3% negative headwind associated with non-cash straight line. Complementing property contributions, we anticipate the positive momentum we saw in our U.S. services segment in 2024 to continue into 2025, resulting in an increase to services gross margin of nearly $30 million. The operating leverage inherent in our business model is expected to be amplified by prudent cost controls and lower bad debt expense, including another year of cash SG&A declines of approximately $20 million. Turning to slide 11, 2025 attributable AFFO per share of $10.40 represents growth of over 4 percent relative to 2024 attributable AFFO per share as adjusted of $9.96 and growth of approximately 7 percent on an FX neutral basis. Performance is supported by a strong conversion of cash-adjusted EBITDA growth through tightly managed cash taxes and maintenance CapEx, partially offset by net interest headwinds of $80 million, a roughly 1.7% negative impact to growth. On slide 12, I'll review our capital allocation plans for 2025. We expect to resume dividend growth in the mid-single-digit range subject to Board approval. which corresponds to an approximately $3.2 billion distribution to our shareholders. Next, we're planning for $1.7 billion in capital deployments, of which $1.5 billion is discretionary in nature and includes the construction of 2,250 sites at the midpoint. Approximately 80% of our discretionary spend is centered on our developed market platforms, including over $600 million in success-based investments towards our data center campuses to replenish the record level of capacity sold over the past several years, increased spend in the U.S., primarily towards land buyouts under our tower sites, and continued acceleration in European new tower construction with 600 new sites planned. While overall capital spend is moderately increasing year to year, as we execute on attractive development opportunities across the U.S., Europe, and core site, we continue to reduce spend across our emerging markets. In 2025, investments in Latin America, Africa, and APAC will primarily consist of augmenting sites to accommodate incremental tenants in meeting multi-year agreement obligations with leading carriers, primarily through new builds. Execution of our strategic balance sheet priorities since closing the core site acquisition has us well positioned to deliver more sustained and durable earnings growth partially mitigate market risk and volatility, and provide financial flexibility to execute on opportunistic and strategic growth opportunities at an attractive cost of capital. Our liquidity position of $12 billion, including $10 billion of bank facility capacity, along with our low floating debt exposure, provides optionality to manage the $3.7 billion of fixed note maturities in 2025. Our plan continues to target maintaining floating rate debt exposure below 10%, which we believe is a reasonable target for the foreseeable future. Moving to slide 13 and in summary, our fundamental business proved resilient throughout a volatile macroeconomic backdrop in 2024 as carriers continue to invest in their networks across our global footprint to address growing mobile data demand, Although market volatility continues to persist, including interest rate and FX uncertainty, the quality of our assets, people, counterparties, and contract terms combined with the strategic steps we executed over the course of 2024 to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance earnings quality have us well positioned to deliver stronger growth in returns for our shareholders over the long term. With that, operator, we can open the line for questions. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press 1 then 0 on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1-0 command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press 1 then 0 at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead. Thanks and good morning. First, can you give us some additional details on what you're seeing in the domestic leasing environment, including the mix of, you know, COLO versus amendments? And is that mix affecting kind of the book to bill, you know, for the OTPG metrics, you know, over the course of 25? And then just maybe second and to the point about domestic leasing opportunities, can you give us an update on the multi-year growth opportunity? And do you still see annual growth in the mid single digit range going through 2027? Thanks. Yeah, thanks for the question, Mike. Yeah, we're not changing our long-term guidance in terms of what we believe the the average to be from that 2023 through 2027 time period. And when we look at this year's OTBG in particular, there is a little bit of a mix, but it's a little bit more nuanced than just COLOs versus amendments. We do have a sequential step down in our contracted use right fee under our comprehensive agreements. As we told you guys when we laid out the guidance, we had more visibility early in that process. It gets a little bit less each year. And so our organic tenant billings growth is a factor of those use fees, plus the incremental amendments and new leases that are outside of those contracted use fees. So we do still have one customer that's not on a comprehensive agreement with respect to amendments, and then we also have co-locations that are outside of the contracted use fees with some other customers as well. And so what we're seeing from an activity level is a robust pipeline from all of our carriers. It's kind of broad-based across the three national carriers, and that is still a healthy mix. of amendments and co-locations we are seeing a rise in new co-locations across the portfolio that's a combination of continuing to extend the reach of the network so going into some more rural areas but also some early stage gentrification that we're seeing so we are seeing that that mix change a little bit when you look at the 2025 guide because less of that revenue is part of the comprehensive use fees, we are more subject to timing on that. And we do see a little bit more of a delay in kind of the signing and commencing of those. Those use right fees tend to be kind of front end loaded in the year, and these others will come kind of throughout the year. And that OTBG metric is so sensitive to kind of the in-year revenue piece that, you know, even a 30-, 60-, 90-day delay in commencements can make a difference there. So that's why it's a little bit, we're not, you know, giving a flat-out number. We're giving a greater than or equal to 4.3 because, you know, we'll see what the commencement timing is on that. But that is a combination of the amendments from the customer that are outside of the agreement and the co-locations. And that does extend the kind of the book-to-bill timeline out just a little bit. Michael, maybe I'll just add a point here that roughly 4.3 that Steve talked about, in terms of organic tenant buildings growth for the US. That's in line with our prior expectation and does fit in and support our full year outlook for 2024, as well as that longer term multi-year guide that we had provided earlier, which was roughly 5% organic tenant buildings growth in the US on average from 2017 out to 2024. So we are pretty well on track with that. The other thing I would highlight is within that, equal to or greater than 4.3% includes two percentage points contributed from churn. Roughly half of that is from sprint churn, which will not be reoccurring next year. So that will be an inflection point where that number certainly is expected to be higher going into next year. Just to clarify, that guide was 2023 to 2027. Oh, right, right. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Steve, if I could come back to the data center business, great to see the strong performance there. Just want to get a sense of how the original concept of the integration of the data center connectivity, the towers, AI inference, and so forth, how are you thinking about that today? And I guess one of the concerns is we've got this massive multiple gap between data centers and towers, and are you getting full recognition for the assets that you hold given the predominance of the tower business? So I'd love to get your thoughts about is it worth owning this versus separating that? And then I think there was a reference, Rod, maybe to more money on U.S. land purchases. Can you just give us a sense of what's driving that? How are you thinking about the economics now that's leading you to lean into that this year? Thanks. Yeah, thanks for the question, Simon. So we're very happy with the performance of CoreSight and how it's doing as kind of a standalone business. As you mentioned, the original reason we bought CoreSight strategically was number one, we knew it was a good business, and number two, we thought it would give us an advantage when the industry does move to edge compute. We still believe there will be a convergence of kind of the wireless edge as well as the wireline edge. And we still have strong conviction that that will happen. In the meantime, we're focused on maximizing the value of core site. So when we think about whether we're the right owner of that asset, as long as we're maximizing the value of that asset, we think it makes sense for us to hold it and to continue to grow it because we do believe that that long-term strategy will play out. Now, if for some reason it looks like that doesn't play out or it's not a strategic fit, we'll reassess that when the time comes. But at this point, we've Everything that we're seeing leads us to believe that you will continue to see an evolution to the edge, and we believe having that interconnection ecosystem, and to be clear, it's not just having a data center company, but it's having a highly interconnected ecosystem with multi-cloud environments is what's going to be essential for an edge to work, and that's also what we're already seeing play out in terms of AI, those multi-cloud environments are also the ideal places for inferencing for AI. So as this whole ecosystem evolves over time, we think we're well-placed to capture that demand as it evolves. And so we believe that we are the right owner for that asset as we continue to maximize its value and evolve that kind of future offering out there. But like I said, we'll continue to assess it. And if at any point you think that somebody else can create more value than we can, we'll make that assessment at that time. Hey, Simon, good morning. I think the second question you had was around land purchases under our towers in the U.S. You can see in the numbers that we put out for the guide for 25, we're driving that up to about $200 million invested in 24. That was about 144. So a nice inflection point there and a higher level of investment. The key there is a couple of things that I would highlight. One is, you know, we're very selective in terms of which parcels of land we purchase and we look to purchase land under our very best towers. to secure the revenue over the long term. To either extend, you know, we certainly look to extend those leases out 20, 30 years and also buy them or get perpetual easements when and where we can. So one of the metrics that you've heard us talk about in the past is the percentage of land or percentage of towers where we have long-term security on the land. And we've got that up to north of, up in the high 70s at this point. That's partly through the execution of extending leases, but also purchasing these leases. And not only does the purchase of the land under the towers secure the future revenue and cash flow of the tower, it's also a great use of capital in terms of the outright returns. We get returns that are well above our hurdle rates in the US. And again, we can be pretty selective in terms of which towers and where the returns are. All in all, it's a great use of capital. It helps drive growth, secure revenue, and it gives us good returns. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Batia Levi from UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you. A couple follow-ups on the domestic activity. I think you mentioned 65% of towers in the U.S. have been upgraded. What does that metric look like for the carriers that are outside of the comprehensive deal? And maybe in terms of the pacing, new leasing pacing for the year, I think you mentioned mid three, so about 170 million versus the 180 we saw last year. How should we think about the cadence through the year? And one final question, if I could. On capital allocation with leverage inside your target now, and dividend growth potentially starting? How do you think about buybacks? Thank you. Okay, I'll take the first one. And so when you think about the care activity, I don't want to get too specific because my customers get mad at me about that. But I'll just kind of reiterate that we have one customer that's upgraded mid-band 5G on over 80%, one customer that's about 65%, and one that's still a little bit under half. And I think with some of their public statements, you guys can probably figure out who those are. In terms of the timings for the new business throughout the year, I think was your second question. As we think about that cadence, the impact of the sprint churn is probably the biggest factor that will change the cadence on that. So the last Trump to sprint chart hit in October of 2024. So that will weigh on the OTPG metric for the first three quarters. So you should expect those three quarters to have a little bit lower growth because it's weighed down by that churn and coming out to a higher growth rate on the back end of that. In terms of the activity cadence, we are exiting 2024 after four quarters of sequential growth. We expect 2025 to be roughly the same volume of applications on our sites. And I think we think it may be a little bit more front end loaded this time. But it's really hard to tell exactly what cadence that's going to be in terms of when the applications come in because the carriers are still finalizing their plans. So we'll see how that works out. But, you know, the early indications is, you know, last year it ramped up from the first half of the back. There might be a slight ramp down this year, but it's too early to know for sure how that's going to pan out. Yeah, and Bhatia, maybe I would just add a couple of things. One is in that in the U.S., of course, we do have Sprint churn. The timing of that is it'll impact the organic tenant billings numbers over the first three quarters, and then it will be absent in Q4. So the churn numbers, the raw numbers, we're looking at about 98, $100 million of churned revenue in 2025. We're going to start off the year at roughly a run rate of about $30 million a quarter of churn, and that includes sprint churn. Sprint churn is a little more than half of it. It's about $140 million. basis points over those first three quarters. And then that churn number in Q will reduce down to about $10 million or so. Got it. And the buyback? And then on the new business piece, you're right. We had about 180 million of new business in 24. That's going down to about 165 in that range, 170. you know, right in that range. And we do see, although we do see a dip, as Steve talks about, from the end of last year going into Q1 and Q2, we do think there's an acceleration, modest acceleration that could be seen at the end of the year. When it comes to buybacks, you know, we are at about 5.1 times leverage at the end of 2024. Our view is that we will be at or below five times early in 2025. That certainly returns us to full financial flexibility. So, leverage would not be a kind of an overweight consideration as we move forward. Now, with that said, we have to continue to look at interest rates. There continues to be uncertainty in the macroeconomic backdrop and with rates, you know, with the rate environment. So, depending on where rates go and what the outlook is, we'll make decisions on capital allocation. We could certainly de-lever further if we think that is in the best interest of our shareholders because of uncertainty around rates. But otherwise, we see very constructive ways to deploy growth capital in the developed markets, clearing the hurdle rates, getting very good long-term growth and value creation. We also will be looking at other ways to supplement that, and that could be through M&A or buybacks. We'll look at both. We'll be very disciplined, and the measure there will be driving shareholder value over the long term. I would say we're definitely open to share buybacks. We're open to allocating capital over the next several years. We will have capital generation in the business that we will have the ability to deploy, and we will be using all the tools available to us to create maximum value for shareholders over the long term. Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rick Prentice from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I have a couple questions for you. First of all, my friend Simon, who we're going to miss you, man. But following Simon's questions on the data center side, what kind of yields are you getting on the over $600 million on the data centers? And then when, if, when, how does AI affect towers? We're all trying to figure out how that might play out. And then I'll have one more. Thanks, Rick. So all of our development in CoreSight is being underwritten at mid-teen stabilized yields, and that's a number that they were able to achieve as a standalone company, and we have certainly not diminished any of the underwriting standards for that over time as we've owned them. There's potentially the opportunity to do better than that if we outperform the business case on those, but everything is being underwritten at that. So again, we think that's a really good place to deploy capital. When it comes to AI on towers, I think it's hard to predict exactly when you're going to see it. If you look at how AI is developing, the time gap between you do something on your desktop and when you do it on your phone has pretty much disappeared. People like to be able to do things in the mobile world like they can on their desk. So as you see these different activities evolving, the way I think about it is what's going to be bandwidth intensive? If you're interacting with AI on your phone today, it's largely text or still photograph. And those are not huge bandwidth hogs. So it really comes down to video. I'm really encouraged by what I'm seeing kind of evolving in the AI space. OpenAI has launched Sora to a kind of a select group of people that hasn't been broadly released yet. But when that becomes more mainstream, that'll put bandwidth. Google announced VO2. Adobe announced Firefly. So you're starting to see these video AI applications being launched. I think as those become more widespreadly, you know, use more widespread in a more widespread fashion, that will start making its way to the mobile phone. That will be more bandwidth intensive. That will put stress on the networks. And so I do think that the incremental use case of AI is going to be a factor in requiring more densification on the networks over time. The question is, when are we all creating videos on our phones? That makes sense. Okay. And following up on Bacha's question, go ahead, Rob. Sorry, Rick, I'll just add a couple of comments here briefly around the data center comments that Steve made. So as you know, we've seen accelerating revenue growth in the data center business. We're up to double-digit growth here. Along with that certainly comes some pretty good pricing power on our side. The demand backdrop is really strong. That is driving our average monthly recurring rent per cab up. So that's gone up a couple hundred dollars in the last couple of years. That's evidence of the strong pricing that we're able to drive, and we're in a position to be very selective in terms of who's coming into the spaces and making sure that they fit into that ecosystem, which is interconnecting, connecting with other enterprise customers, connecting into the cloud, connecting into the networks that we have in there. The other thing that I would highlight is the modest increases in CapEx you've seen over the last couple of years, we see that directly driving up our backlog. And our backlog now is at an all-time high of north of $80 million. And that's going to sustain solid revenue growth over the next couple of years. So that business is really well positioned, performing very well, and is in line to continue to perform well for the foreseeable future. And the other thing I would say is the increases that you're seeing in the capital in the data center business, we're also increasing capital in Europe. We're also increasing capital in the U.S. tower business through the land purchases that Simon asked about. And at the same time, we're decreasing capital investments on the development side across Africa, LATAM, and APAC. Okay. And then on Bhatia's question, you mentioned that there could be some other M&A that would fit into the mix on stock buybacks or not. Previously, you've been thinking there's not many portfolios out there that were of interest or value creation to you. I'm not putting words in your mouth, I don't think, there. But anything changing on that dynamic as far as more portfolios coming out? Are they coming from mobile network operators? Are they coming from privates that want to exit? What are you kind of thinking as far as what might be in that pipeline of potential M&A for tower deals? Yeah, there's nothing else that we're seeing out there right now, Rick. I mean, there's a few portfolios that people are talking about, but nothing at this point looks to us to be something where we can create the type of value that we would need to see. I mean, again, to reiterate, for us to do something M&A, It has to be strategically important to us, and one plus one has to equal three. So we've got to think that we can create more value in that portfolio than anybody else. So it's possible we'll find some small portfolios domestically where we think that using our teams and what we know in marketing to our customers, we can do a better job than other folks. You might see some small portfolios like that. But at the end of the day, it's got to be better than a stock buyback for us to do M&A. And so we'll be... holding the team to a pretty high standard before we approve anything in the M&A world. So nothing on the horizon right now that we see that would be compelling. Great. Thanks for that update. Appreciate it. Your next question comes from the line of Nick DelDio from Moffitt Nathanson. Please go ahead. Hey. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. You know, first, Steve, you – Achieving cost efficiencies has been a real area of focus for you, and you've been quite successful on that front over the past couple of years. I guess in your prepared remarks, you alluded to sharing long-term efficiency targets with us in the future. So I don't want you to share anything with us today before you're comfortable doing so, but at a high level, can you expand on that and maybe kind of tell us about the magnitude of savings you think American Tower can potentially achieve on this front over time? Sure, but I'm not going to give you a target yet. So when you think about what we've done so far, our focus initially was on SG&A. And as we have changed the focus in many of our markets to harvesting the cash flows that are there versus aggressively trying to grow those markets, that gave us an opportunity to rethink the organization. And so that gave us some short-term savings. Those are durable, recurring SG&A savings on functions that we either just didn't need to do anymore that we could do regionally. globalizing our business for a period of time, we're accelerating that now. And one of the reasons that we asked Bud to take the job as COO was to really look at what kind of benefits can we get across the globe by looking at our core operations. As we were growing aggressively globally, we grew in kind of a decentralized manner. And so we weren't getting, you know, we're as focused on being as efficient as possible in every market all the time because we're growing so fast. And what we've asked Bud to do is take a look at this global operations across all of our markets and to try to figure out what's that next level of savings. So again, the SG&A was kind of the, that was the first area we're targeting. As Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are targeting a bit more savings this year. But the next phase of this is to look at all of our operations. And the question is, what can we do in terms of our directs? What can we do, you know, operations and maintenance, utilities, supply chain, And I just don't have the answer yet. Bud's still running a project to see what that's going to look like. We know that there's some savings out there. Not prepared to share a magnitude of that with you yet because we're still sizing it up. But I look forward to doing that as soon as I can pin down Bud on this and get a clear goal from him on what he's willing to sign up to. But that's something that we'll be sharing with you in the future as we work through those numbers. Hey, Nick, maybe I would just add to Steve's comments around SG&A is that the SG&A efficiency that you so rightfully highlight is only one piece of the priorities that we laid out a couple years ago. So, you know, we really were looking at a multi-year, multi-faceted set of priorities which were driving organic growth through the business, driving operational efficiency through the business, improving our quality of earnings and strengthening the balance sheet The SG&A piece is certainly evidence of us staying focused and executing diligently. We've done that across all of these pieces with the sale of our India business. We sold some other smaller businesses like the land that we had down in Australia. We just announced that we're signed an agreement to sell the fiber business down in South Africa, and we're looking at a few other smaller things there. We've been very focused on driving organic growth, and you can see that in the consistency of the numbers that we're putting up. With a balance sheet strength, you've seen us kind of rotate the balance sheet. We're now down to about 3 percent floating rate debt, which really insulates us somewhat from the volatility and the uncertainty around rates, gives us more certainty, which has been really good. And we've also received the S&P upgrade from a credit rating standpoint. SG&A is certainly an important piece of us driving costs down, being efficient, and it's combined with us executing across the consistent priorities that we laid out a couple years ago. Great. Thanks for all the call on that front, guys. I guess one on CoreSight for you as well. Historically, when they were public, we'd see the stats by Metro. the capacity and the demand was really skewed towards the Bay Area, LA, and Northern Virginia. Have you seen the demand patterns change at all such that it's broadened out across your markets? Or do those three markets continue to garner kind of a lopsided share of demand? Well, certainly those campuses continue to see increased demand. But what we've seen is that ecosystem development that we've worked so hard to do across all of our markets is really paying off. So we're seeing in our key markets like Chicago and New York that those campuses are becoming just as desirable as what we're seeing in Silicon Valley, LA, and Northern Virginia. So it really is a testament to the business model they have where they curate that customer mix, bring in the networks, the clouds, and the enterprises, and that kind of intersection ecosystem. That's what makes it attractive, and we are seeing that play out in those markets. And that's why in my prepared remarks I mentioned you might see us do small tuck in inorganics. I've referred previously to Miami where we bought a small data center. What we've asked the team to do is look at new campuses. Is there a way to expand into other markets to build those over time just the way we did in Chicago and New York most recently so that you get even more campuses that are performing that way? That's also why we're building DE3 right now in Denver is to try to turn that market into another desirable campus. So we think we've got a good track record of doing that. We think there's more opportunities out there, and we'll continue to support the CoreSite team as they create those campuses. But we are seeing a much more balanced load now than what you saw previously in our public. That's great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your view of the U.S. carrier activity relative to fixed wireless access, and specifically, are you seeing any of your carrier customers devoting new capacity specifically for that purpose, as far as you can tell? It would be very tough for us to peg it specifically to fixed wireless. They're still using their existing wireless networks to serve that, so we're not seeing a separate network going up for fixed wireless. I think that anything that puts demand on the network makes it more likely that they're going to add more equipment over time, but that's not something that we can kind of parse out and see specifically on that. If you listen to the care commentary, they still say they're using fallow capacity in their existing networks. I'm certainly not going to contradict my customers on that, but I am encouraged by them raising their targets for the number of customers that are going to be served on fixed wireless. I'm also encouraged by the returns they're able to get on that product and the positive signs in their business, some of which is attributable to fixed wireless. So I think it's generally a boon for the entire industry, and I think certainly we'll see our piece of that as that business develops over time. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, specifically relative to Europe, you're guiding for organic 10 buildings worth about 5%. Is that the right number on a multi-year basis, do you believe? Do you think there's a potential for acceleration there in the out-years? And then maybe give us your view, if you would, on any M&A opportunities specifically in that region. Is that an area where you'd like to increase your focus or not? Thank you. Thanks. In terms of kind of our longer-term view of Europe, I mean, mid-single digits is kind of what we see that market being over time, so we think that's a durable... growth rate for us. There are a couple piece parts of that. We do have CPI-linked escalators, so that will vary over time with what's going on with inflation there. But certainly the core business activity is very encouraging, what we're seeing there. We're seeing a little bit more competition. We're seeing expansion into rural areas that's being required by the governments. They are a bit behind on some of their 2030 targets in terms of the population they'd like to serve there. So I think that there is an opportunity for them to catch up with that plan if they keep investing there. Also, if you look at their penetration for mid-band 5G, it's lagging a little bit behind the U.S. I think that they're roughly 45% of the population served by mid-band 5G at this point. And so I think you'll see a continued pace of deployment by those carriers. Now, you are seeing a little bit of carrier consolidation in certain markets there, as we are across the globe, as we saw here in the U.S. But again, we think that they emerge from those situations with maybe fewer carriers, but stronger carriers with more capital to deploy. That's probably a good sign for the longer term. So we feel very constructive on Europe as a whole. Now, when we look at M&A, it's certainly a market that we think has potential. The question is, can we find the right portfolio with the right terms and conditions and the right price? We're not going to go into a market just to go into a market. We're not going to buy a portfolio just to get some scale there. For us, it comes down to two main components. The first is price. And right now, everything that's traded in Europe is trading at a price that has kept us on the sidelines a bit. The other aspect is terms and conditions. We were very patient before we pulled the trigger on the Telefonica portfolio because we saw portfolios trading with terms and conditions that just weren't conducive to long-term value creation. And we've enumerated those in the past, so I won't go into a lot of detail on those again. But we don't want portfolios that don't give us long-term durable growth. And so even if the price was right, we would sit out on those opportunities. So what I'd say about Europe is I'm cautiously optimistic that we might find opportunities to grow there. But there's nothing that we've seen today that has been compelling enough for us to really kind of get into the weeds on it. And we'll continue to be patient and disciplined before we do anything material there. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Cho from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Great. I wanted to ask about the services business, the 30% growth and the margin contribution. Can you give us a sense of how that should kind of grow through the year and what you're seeing there? And then I have one follow-up. Yeah, thanks, Richard. So we do have a good backlog of projects going into the year, so we do think that we're going to see some nice ramp-up in that in 2025. It's a combination of a couple of different aspects of the business, though. We have our kind of normal services business, which is tied to just normal deployment, where we're doing some work for the carriers on permitting things like that. We also have construction services that's becoming a larger component of that. And construction services are something that we don't do nationwide, and we don't do it for all the carriers. It's really a very niche thing that we do for a couple of customers and a couple of markets because we've been able to structure teams and deals there where we can earn a nice margin, but more importantly, serve our customers well and get them on air on time. So when you look at that guide for next year, there's a little bit more construction in there, but overall activity is expected to be up year over year in terms of that. And so at this point, we have more visibility into the first half of the year. As I've said before, it's extremely hard to predict services for the full year because it's a little bit more variable, but we feel good about the guide we put out and we'll continue to monitor it and we'll see what happens in the back half of the year. And then in terms of your Canadian business, can we get a little bit of color of how things are going there and any desire to get bigger in Canada? Sure. It's a very small business for us. We just have a little over a couple hundred towers there. And it's going well. It's growing well. We're seeing nice activity levels on it. The Canadian market's an interesting market. The carriers have not traditionally monetized their towers there. And so we'll continue to kind of see how that plays out. You know, all the developed markets have some different kind of characteristics to them. The Canadian market in particular has a lot of network sharing that's been part of that market throughout its history. You're seeing people building more differentiated networks today, so there is a little bit less sharing actually in some areas than there were before. So we'll continue to monitor that. But the comments I made for Europe hold true for Canada as well. Terms and conditions are extremely important. Price is extremely important. And you won't see us doing anything to get scale there that doesn't meet those criteria. So there's no kind of strategic reason why we would pay up to get into that market. We'll just evaluate the portfolio for its growth opportunities. And if we did something there, it's because we got the appropriate price in terms of conditions. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to you for any closing comments. Thank you all for joining the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the investor relations team. Thanks, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.
