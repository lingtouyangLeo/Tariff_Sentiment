For additional information, please refer to PPE's filings with the SEC. Now, let me introduce PPE Chairman and CEO, Tim Konevich. Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our second quarter 2024 financial performance, and then I'll move to our outlook. The PPG team delivered sales of 4.8 billion in our seventh consecutive quarter of year over year segment margin improvement. This culminated in second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.50, which is an all time record for the company and represents 11% year-over-year growth. Despite increasingly challenging macroeconomic conditions, we are building top-line momentum as our underlying year-over-year volume progression improved for the sixth consecutive quarter. In the second quarter, six of our 10 business units delivered positive volume growth versus prior year, aided by our enterprise growth strategy initiatives. These initiatives include delivering new products and technologies to our customers, such as our innovative packaging interior can and exterior end coatings technologies, as well as our new Sigma Glide technology in our marine business. Each of these technologies has allowed us to gain share in their respective businesses. Our actions also include upgrading and modernizing our manufacturing capabilities to drive increased output, such as in aerospace where demand has outpaced industry supply. One additional example of our enterprise growth strategy is where we're driving changes to the ecosystem of the business models. This includes in architectural coatings U.S. and Canada with our Home Depot initiative, in our refinish business with our digital tools such as Moonwalk and Link, and in our traffic solutions business as we further optimize our service and supply capabilities, which are critical value drivers in this business. Additionally, our volume performance in the quarter benefited from our well-established business portfolio in Mexico, China, and India. Overall, however, our aggregate volumes in the quarter were flat year over year, falling shy of our initial expectations as overall demand in Europe and global auto OEM production were below what we assumed in our second quarter guidance. It is important to note that our European volumes, while still negative, improved sequentially year over year versus the first quarter. Also, global industrial activity remained subdued in the quarter. Consistent with our financial guidance in April, our second quarter automotive refinish sales were down year over year, reflecting a strong prior year comparison and lower insurance claims. However, we remain confident that this business will have a strong second half of 2024. In the quarter, we drove further margin enhancement and we marked our seventh consecutive quarter of year over year segment margin improvement. Our aggregate gross margin was 43% for the quarter, a 180 basis point improvement year over year. Our performance coatings segment achieved all-time record segment margin of 18.7%. And our industrial coatings segment also improved its margin profile by 120 basis points versus the prior year. During the second quarter, we benefited from stable upstream and downstream supply chains, and the vast majority of our suppliers have sufficient or excess capacity, which is noteworthy as this occurred during the peak season for raw material consumption. Consistent with our guidance, we experienced mid-single-digit percentage raw material deflation that we expect will normalize into flat to low single-digit deflation for the third quarter as we anniversary prior year impacts. This benefit was partially offset in our results by general inflation, including higher year-over-year wages and employee benefits. We are proud to have published our 2023 ESG report in the quarter, which highlighted progress against our 2030 targets, including increasing sales from sustainably advantaged products and reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout our own operations and our value chain. I want to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on our previously announced strategic reviews of the architectural coatings U.S. and Canada business and the global silicas product business. We made good progress with these processes and are pleased to have a number of engaged and interested parties. We're working through the traditional bidding, management presentation, and data provision stages and remain on our original schedule to determine a path forward for each of these assessments. We have also made further progress in driving improvement in working capital, including lowering our year-over-year inventories during the quarter. As a result, our operating working capital was down 90 basis points year-over-year. We have more work to do over the balance of the year as we move towards seasonally slower sales quarters, but we have already returned to near pre-pandemic inventory levels. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and remain committed to deploy excess cash for shareholder value creation. During the quarter, we repurchased $150 million of PPG shares, bringing our year-to-date total to about $300 million. This is on top of our fourth quarter 2023 repurchases. Also yesterday, consistent with our long heritage, our board authorized a $0.03 dividend increase from $0.65 to $0.68 per share. Now, looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect overall organic sales of flat to low single-digit percentage growth. In Mexico, we expect to again deliver excellent financial results. We also believe that demand in China will deliver organic growth as a result of our technology-advantaged products, but albeit at a lower growth rate than achieved in the first half of the year. In Europe, demand remains uneven by country and end use, but we expect modest sequential year-over-year improvement. In addition to those businesses that grew in the second quarter, we expect organic growth in automotive refinish coatings and protective and marine coatings. And also, while slightly unfavorable year-over-year, we are projecting modest sequential quarterly improvement in general industrial demand. We expect to deliver adjusted third quarter EPS between $2.10 and $2.20 per share, aided by solid operating performance. Our guidance midpoint is 4% higher than our record third quarter 2023. However, the midpoint of our guidance is 10% higher than the third quarter of 23, excluding the impact of a higher year-over-year tax rate, as the prior year included several non-recurring favorable discrete tax items. The difference in the tax rate is reducing our year-over-year EPS comparison by approximately 12 cents at the midpoint. We anticipate overall company selling prices to be flat in the third quarter, as the impact of certain index-based customer contracts in our industrial coding segment will be offset by selling price increases in our performance coding segment, including some additional incremental pricing that will be realized in the third quarter. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we continue to realize benefits for moderating input costs. In the third quarter, we expect flat to low single-digit percentage raw material deflation, lower than the second quarter as we anniversary some decrease realized in 2023. As we have consistently demonstrated, we will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by sales volume growth leverage as a result of the execution of our enterprise growth strategy and self-help in manufacturing productivity and cost control initiatives, which includes continued execution of our previously approved restructuring actions. Our more than 50,000 employees are committed to delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers that will drive growth for PPG. Our results this quarter were made possible by our highly dedicated team around the world who make it happen and deliver on our purpose to protect and beautify the world every day. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe the first one would just be on the US-Canada architectural review. It sounds like you're getting a reasonable amount of interest. Would you say that that's increasing the likelihood of a sale versus some of the other avenues, JVs, partnerships? I think, you know, you kind of said at the beginning of all this, any option is open, but it sounded like a sale was the preference. Would you say there's a high likelihood of this ending up being a sale? Hey, John, thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the level of interest in the architectural U.S.-Canada business, and I will say that level of interest has great diversity across the scenarios that may end up being the final path forward. So it's just too early at this point to say which one of those is kind of leading the pack, as we've had – really good interest in a number of different scenarios from, you know, full sale to JV and other forms of partnerships. So just too early, John, but we are making good progress. Yeah, John, this is Vince. As Tim said in the opening remarks, we're in the normal process working with these interested parties, working with our bankers, having traditional management meetings, et cetera. So we remain on our original schedule to – to determine a path forward. Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yeah, good morning, guys. Question on auto OE. So the numbers you put up were worse than, you know, like if we're looking at just the global auto builds, you know, S&P or IHS. Is that a customer footprint issue? Is it a destocking by the customer first? And then do we need the anniversary of that? Are there two more quarters after this that are going to kind of be down high single digits to get to a new level of run rate? Hey, Duffy. Thanks for the question. You know, our numbers, our projections may have been a bit different than what you're seeing from some of the kind of global services, service providers. A couple of things there. You know, we do have a very strong position in Europe, which was down more than average. And also, our projections, while services maybe are looking more at macros, our projections for Q3 in particular are based on what we actually see in specific assembly plant schedules at the plants that we serve. And a number of them have increased just very recently, increased their summer downtimes. So that may have a disproportionate impact versus what you may be seeing publicly. And then finally, I'd say, as you know, we have a very strong position in China. And we did see a step down in China production plans, you know, as soon as the EV tariffs were announced. And I think some of our customers are playing it cautious here until they see how that scenario plays out. Because as you know, particularly the largest producer there is exporting quite a bit there. So we do think that's a transitory item that will play out. Yeah, and Duffy, this is Vince. Just a point of clarification on our materials. We provide organic sales numbers, which for us includes volume and price. As we've alluded to many times this year in this business and in our industrial segment, we have index-based pricing. So excluding price, we're much closer to the service provider numbers that you alluded to in your question. So you have to bifurcate price first volume. Your next question comes from the line of Gangshan Punjabi with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning. Thank you. You know, Tim, can you give us a bit more color on the volume trend line in Europe during the second quarter? You know, you mentioned it was a bit below your forecast. Which specific businesses perhaps were a little bit below, I think you called that, auto EM? And then secondly, you know, in terms of the flattish volumes on a consolidated basis year over year for 2Q and the margin improvement, which is quite significant, can you just give us some of the high-level drivers of that? Thank you for the questions. Yeah, the volume trend in Q2 did play out a little worse than we expected, particularly at the end of the quarter. June in particular was soft, largely driven by what I just said on Duffy's question that certain assembly plants started to add additional down weeks. And that affected U.S. and Europe. So that was one thing that played out. The other one is the deco business in Europe, softer than we expected, again, particularly in the last month of the quarter. A little more color there. You know, we're very strong in France, and that's one of our larger countries for sales. And as you know, that had some unique situations going on there. So that did slow down for us in June. But interestingly, a subset of the Europe story is Eastern Europe has been stronger than expected, where we actually also have a very strong position in countries like Poland and others. So it's really those two businesses in Europe that trended downward as the quarter progressed. The overall volume being flat versus what we had previously said was really driven globally by auto and locally in Europe by architectural. Those were the two big ones. But, you know, as I said in my opening remarks, we have been improving sequentially over the last six quarters. If you go back to end of 22, we were down – negative five percent in volume and that has steadily improved to where we you know we're printing flat this quarter and also um in my remarks i said there were six out of ten businesses that were positive volume for us just to give you some context there last year that was three out of ten so we went from three out of ten to six out of ten and we're planning on eight out of ten in q3 being positive so A little under where we wanted to be for Q2, largely driven by end of quarter in those two businesses, but we feel good about the momentum, Ganshin. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolf Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Good morning, everybody. You know, I don't think any of us are really going to doubt that the macro has been a little bit choppier than most were anticipating into the second quarter, but You know, Tim, you've been really focused in the portfolio and your ability to outgrow certain end markets. You know, I know it's still a bit early and perhaps tough to tell, but what would be at this juncture, the two to three end markets, where you are by far and away the most comfortable in PPG's ability to consistently outperform market growth rates? Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. You know, number one, aerospace. You know, we're really just... As I've said for the last several quarters, everything we can make is sold and shipped. We're adding capacity. We're improving productivity. We've improved output in this past quarter. So we're selling more, and we'll continue to outperform. I always say that with refinish, you really have to look over a full year basis with this business because you always have order pattern issues. from the distributors around the world, refinish. We continue to gain, share, and refinish by execution of our digital systems, which have been widely accepted and embraced, and we keep adding to that toolbox of new digital tools, Chris. So I feel really good about that, this packaging outperforming from a volume standpoint, and we still haven't launched everything that we've won in the last few quarters. Traffic, although not our biggest business, I want to point to a business that the first couple of years I would say we cleaned up that business, and now we're in a position where it is really starting to perform for us. Other businesses vary very much by specific region, but those would be the four that overall I would say were outperforming. But I do want to point out three other things. Aggregate Mexico. Just Mexico across the board, whether it's PPG COMEX or our industrial segment businesses or protective encodings, protective marine, we outperform Mexico. Aggregate China, of course, with excluding DECO where we don't play. Aggregate China, we're outperforming. Aggregate India, except for DECO where we don't play, we're outperforming. So that's how I would describe the businesses that, you know, I feel most confident about our overperformance going forward, Chris. Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Tim, as you go through the review of a U.S. paint business, are you seeing any disruptions to the business and particularly see any market share changes? losses due to challenges or disruptions in the business? Thank you. Hey, Dave, we had a very good quarter in that business. So, of course, that was something that we had some concerns about as we announced it, but You know, internally, the team has done a really good job working with our employees, our customers, our distribution partners in the private dealer space, our big box customers. And we had a, you know, we had a good quarter in that business, you know, mid single digit growth. So, you know, while it's something we're watching and monitoring very closely and trying to stay ahead of it, I'd say the team did a really good job in Q2 of doing that, and we're expecting the same in Q3. There's lots of discussions. Of course, there's some anxieties. But so far, that has not had any kind of sizable impact on the financial results. Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Masuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you, Tim. Are you still on track with the silicas sale as well, and how do you feel about the rest of the specialty materials portfolio? Yeah, John, thanks for the question. Silicas, we're very much on track with that, maybe even a little ahead of where we are on architectural U.S., Canada. We've had good interest there as well, and let's just say we're on our original, original schedule. Um, the rest of that specialty business, we really like, and here's why, because we have a leadership position in those spaces and they're high technology spaces, which is right, right in our wheelhouse from a, R&D capability standpoint. So obviously not the biggest part of our portfolio, but that business was one of the good growth engines for us in Q2. We expect that to continue going forward. So they're good businesses for us. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. And Tim, if you had a clean slate of how to report your financials, you have these 10 businesses, you have some looming divestitures. If you were to report that network of businesses, would you choose two segments? And would you allocate them the way they're currently arranged? Or would you consider going down a path of either more segments or reporting revenue by business, something to drive more transparency. Thanks, Steve. You know, it is something I've been giving a lot of thought to, you know, and we'll continue to think about it and see what things look like, you know, post-architectural USCA. But high level, you know, we have a group of businesses that are essentially deliver factory to factory, you know, pure business, B2B type of businesses where they go from our factory to an assembly plant or our factory directly to a paint shop of some kind. And that's a logical fit because they have a lot of synergies, synergies in operations, synergies in raw materials, synergies in supply chain and logistics, and synergies in, you know, science and technology. We have another group of businesses that largely goes through distribution and has a lot of value-add services that are a key part of the value proposition, like aerospace, like refinish, and like protective. So high level, I'm comfortable with it, but it's something we do look at on a regular basis. And we'll take a fresh look once this transaction is done, but I'm pretty comfortable with how we report today. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good morning. In our model, if we look out into 2025, we start to see raw materials move up probably low single digits in the first half of next year. So is that something you'll look to get ahead of from a pricing perspective in the back half of the year, or will you take more of a wait and see approach? And are there any parts of the business where, you know, we forget about refinish and arrow where you have a well-defined pricing power. Are there any parts of the business, maybe auto OEM where you're a little more concerned about being able to pass that through? Yeah. Hey Vincent. So what I would say at a, at a very high level is there's, there's sufficient capacity out there across the supply chain. Cause if you look at the total industry, uh of coatings we're producing less leaders than we did you know pre-covid and so there's high level there's there's still quite a bit of capacity out there of course we do what we can to get ahead of it um and you you pointed to some some places where where we can get ahead of it uh the the other businesses largely the industrial segment um it's typically more real time And in some cases, as you know, businesses are able to get pricing faster than others. You know, and as we discussed during the last inflationary cycle, auto OEM is typically the slowest, but we eventually get there, just like we did last cycle. So I would expect it to play out the same in any cycle that may be on the horizon, whether it's next year or the following year. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sisson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the profitability at U.S. Architectural Paints? Has there been any improvement over the last year? Maybe what type of growth do you think that business will generate in the second half? And then finally, Tim, when you think about the full-sale JVR partnership. How are you thinking, you know, how are you thinking which one would be the best transaction for shareholders? Well, you know, the best transaction for shareholders will come down to two pieces. One is, you know, what are the proceeds? What do we get paid for what we're selling? And two, what's the long-term strategic value of anything we might be left with? So that's why it's really hard for me or any of us to say here's the best shareholder value proposal right now because the combination of those two, price, proceeds, and future value of anything we might be left with, we're just not there yet in the process. But that's how we're thinking about it is a combination of shareholder value today for what we get and shareholder value for future. for how it fits with our growth strategy and what we can expect from an earnings and cash flow on the long term. Yeah, and Mike, on current events, look, as Tim just said in an earlier question, business is performing well. Volumes are a key driver to profitability. Our volumes were up in Q2, as we said in prepared remarks. So we're pleased with the progress year to date. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitch with Fermium Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Good morning and congrats, Alex, on your new role. Tim, I want to ask about the expectations for the second half to be lower than you previously thought, you know, which resulted in the full year EPS guide down. I'm just curious, you know, roughly what was the – well, When you think back three months ago or even six months ago when you first put out the full year projection, what sort of level of volume growth were you expecting in the second half of the year? And where are you now in terms of expectations on volume growth for the second half of the year? And I know that part of the reduction is tied to auto OEM. And you said that you've been surprised by the extension of the assembly plant downtime. Just curious, looking back in PPG's history, when you've been surprised in the past by the auto OEMs taking extended assembly plant downtime, does that serve as any sort of foreshadowing of recessionary environments or anything like that? Any color there would be very helpful. Thank you. Hey, Frank. So first of all, what changed from what we're saying about the full year to what we're saying today? It's largely a couple of big businesses like auto, global, and architectural Europe. And, of course, the other businesses are puts and takes, some up, some down. So that's really the biggest driver. And to your second question, I'm not using the recession word at all. What I see more is, you know, temporary adjustments at assembly plants just given vehicles, certain vehicles selling less than they expected and inventories going up a little bit. You know, inventories are still very healthy compared to pre-COVID levels. But, you know, if you look at U.S. inventories, they did creep up a little bit. So I think there's just some adjustment. There's caution from our customers on affordability, interest rates, you know, things that really drive some of the vehicle purchase behavior by consumers. You know, you probably have your own prediction on interest rates. I have mine. But at some point, you know, that should be a pressure that comes off of new car purchases. And I think our customers are just watching the same things very closely, inventories versus affordability and interest rates. But I do not see this as foreshadowing of a recession of any kind. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I'm just curious on your optimism for the refinish outlook for the second half. Which regions do you expect to see the most meaningful growth and how much of a role will Moonwalk and Link play for organic growth? And are you seeing anything in terms of data points or anything in order books that gives you confidence in the underlying market growth in the back half? Yeah, Patrick. So I'd say the biggest confidence point for us is really everywhere outside of Europe where we're really still in the very early innings of launching our productivity digital ecosystem. We started that in Europe, gained tremendous share and customer retention and you know, subscription revenue as we launch that across Europe. And we're still very early days in the US, Australia, China, places like that. So good confidence in the share gain as we roll out those tools around the world. You know, the collision rates are, you know, a question mark depending on where you are around the world. But we believe, you know, our penetration rates of these digital ecosystem is still single digits of all the body shops out there. So, you know, we've still got a lot of runway. And as I said in an earlier answer, we continue to add to that toolbox of digital productivity tools as we go forward. So it is, of course, the chemistry inside the can, which we're best in class at from a color match and speed and all those things. So we feel really good about that, but a lot of our share gain right now is delivered by the productivity tools outside the can. And just to get to your question on the second half of the year, just a little bit of history. Again, in 2023, we had a price increase going into effect in early Q3. We had a lot of our partners buy ahead of that price increase. So as we alluded to in the prepared remarks we had, Very strong Q2 and we finished last year. Softer Q3 given the buy ahead and that pattern reverses this year. So that order pattern from our distributors is helpful for us in the back half of the year. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sikorkas with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thanks very much. A two-part question. you've probably bought all your titanium dioxide through the end of the year. So I understand that there's no TIO2 pressure this year for you. But with sanctions on Chinese product in Europe, is that a structural issue? That is, over the next four years, are you going to be facing as a base case, reasonably higher TIO2 prices or much higher TIO2 prices How do you think about that? And then secondly, in the quarter, your volumes and auto OEM in the US contracted and I think the production grew in the United States in the second quarter. Is that a temporary phenomenon for you or are you losing share in the US? Okay. Hey, Jeff. On the TIO2, you are correct. We foresee no impact in 2024. You know, not so much because we're sitting on a whole bunch of inventory there, but more because we're contractual coverage. As we look to 2025, here's how we are thinking about it. First of all, at a very high level, we continue to reduce TIO to consumption per batch without sacrifice in performance. That's about 1% per year. And even though that doesn't sound like a big number, we've been doing it for a decade. And we expect that to continue. Second thing, specific to the tariffs and anti-dumping issues, We have great flexibility around the world given the formulation work that our S&T teams have done such that we've really increased our sourcing flexibility versus where we were, say, five years ago. And then finally, at the end of the day, if those two initiatives are not enough to counter whatever net increase in cost there may be to us, the biggest consumer of TIO2 is the DECO business by far, and we have demonstrated that, as necessary, we'll offset that cost with price. Jeff, and let me just add on here to the TIO2 question before Tim goes to the next question. Two things. One, we're not either advantaged or disadvantaged versus others in the region as it relates to this issue. So it's going to be an item for all coatings users. Secondarily, not all of our production and not all of our TiO2 consumption is in the EU. We have plants outside of the EU that are not affected by the tariffs. So we still have some capability to produce with unimpacted tariff Chinese TIO2. And, Jeff, to your second question on automotive U.S. specifically, first of all, the final numbers that just came in the last couple days, the production in the U.S. was actually down, down low single digits in the quarter. And, you know, our sales were down mid-single digits. And so some of that would be, you know, Vince talked earlier, you know, the production number that S&P puts out is volume. And our sales number is volume plus price. And we did have some contractual index price in that business. And then the rest of it would be specific assembly plans, specific customer mix that might vary from the, you know, kind of the industry average. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with VRP. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning, everyone. Tim, if I look at your second quarter organic sales results versus your forecast from last quarter, it seems to me that PPG did a very good job of forecasting in maybe eight of the 10 verticals where you compete. The two that I see that came in a little bit lower are architectural EMEA and protective of green coatings. And so I was wondering if you could speak to each of those businesses and maybe educate us a little bit as to why they came in a little bit weaker than you would have thought and whether that was because of sort of transitory or idiosyncratic reasons or do you think they're on a different growth glide path, you know, say looking into 2025. Any additional color on geographies or product lines there would be super helpful. Yeah, sure. Hey, Kevin. Let me do architectural EMEA. Yeah, we were clearly, the results were lower than what we expected for the region in aggregate. We had, we believed that we were, you've heard me use the term bouncing off the bottom. We believed at that time we were on the bottom and we would see sequential improvement Q1 to Q2, the macros, frankly, just got worse in Europe. And that drove Deco, that drove Auto OEM as well. But a little more color there. We're number one in 10 or so countries in Europe. And our biggest is France. I did earlier reference, you've seen the election and some of the turmoil in France that added to uncertainty. And we really did see a downturn in our sales during that period in France, our largest country. So I would say that one was maybe a transitory that as things stabilize, we'll see some recovery there. We're also number one in most of the Nordic countries, which was also slower than the rest of the region. So a little bit of country mixed On the opposite, we're number one in Poland and a number of the Central European countries that have started to recover. So as we think about that going forward, we do believe we will see some sequential improvement in architectural Europe in Q3. We do believe it'll still be down versus prior, Kevin, but we do think that that'll start to sequentially improve. A much better story on protective and marine. As you know, that business has really been a good performer for us over the last several quarters. This is a project business. We just ran into a handful of project delay type transitory items that hit us in the quarter. You should expect growth. back on track in that business starting in Q3. For example, we had slower China infrastructure spending than we expected with the local government issues. With the Mexican election, Pemex was delaying some of its projects. As you know, the election's behind us now, and we're seeing that pick up. We have been doing really well at gain and share in the dry dock business. We had some dry dock delays associated with you know, going around the Cape. So just a number of things like that that we do believe are transitory, but the underlying trends for that business for us are, you know, much stronger than what I would have described for the macro conditions for Deco Europe. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I had two questions on the cost side. I guess first, Your European peer announced some contract renegotiations with its labor force that they talked about as incremental inflationary. Is that an impact at all for PPG in the second half for 2025? And then on the other end, your corporate costs have come in better than you've got in the last couple quarters. With the reduction in guidance, are you accruing less for bonuses for this year? And is that a tailwind that's baked in this year and a headwind next year? If you could help quantify any of that, it would be appreciated. Thank you. Yeah, Josh, this is Vince. With respect to the EU, we're not involved in whatever that appears involved with. We're under our normal process in terms of reviewing our salaries, benefits on an annual basis. We did, as we alluded to at the beginning of the year, have a little bit of a higher wage and benefit inflation this year versus historical given the macro. But, again, we expect that to trend to normal based on what we know today in future years. As it relates to corporate costs, as we said in our press release, we did, due to the lower guidance for the full year, we have made adjustments lower for some of our incentive compensation. And that will – these are not big, big numbers. We'll give a full year 25 guide, as we typically would do in January. We've got to get through the rest of this year before we look at year-over-year impacts, especially line-by-line or category-by-category. Your next question comes from the line of Alexa Yermafro with KeyCorp. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about architectural EMEA pricing. Given these weaker volumes, is pricing holding up in this region or is competitive environment perhaps, you know, more aggressive than for your CODIX portfolio overall? Yeah. Hey, Alexi. You know, given the volume challenges, you know, we have seen – what I would call kind of around the edges, some price downward competitive actions that we've had to match in order to keep our business. That is an outlier versus most of our coding portfolio. But I would also tell you that it's not a huge impact because They're still higher, even though folks are trying to grab volume and the raw material deflation is just not what it was earlier in the year. Us and everyone are experiencing higher wage inflation, higher employee benefit inflation. than let's say maybe a normal year. And we're not the only ones having to deal with that. So I think that is having some impact, whether you're talking about architectural EMEA or where maybe it is slowing down any otherwise volume grab kind of behavior. But across the portfolio, that's enabling, frankly, price to hold up. And that's also enabling things like other parts of our portfolio in performance codings to get additional price because us and everyone else are seeing that higher wage inflation. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lighthead with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. With the strategic reviews on track for this quarter, presumably you'll get some level of cash in the door later this year. So is it fair for us to assume share repurchases are currently your preferred use of excess cash at the moment, or how does the acquisition pipeline look today? Hey, Mike. You know, great shareholder value accretive acquisitions would always be our preferred use of cash, whether it's from proceeds from these potential transactions or just ongoing business. That said, that pipeline is a bit thin right now. And so, you know, we continue to look at opportunities, but overall, compared to prior years, I would assess it as thin. And perhaps that'll change going forward. Perhaps that'll change in 2025. with interest rates. But right now, it's a bit thin. You've seen three quarters in a row. We've bought shares back. We're demonstrating that we're going to do what we said, which is we're not going to let excess cash build on the balance sheet. So, you know, when those transactions or potential transactions close, we will take you know, look at our pipeline. And if it's still thin, then, you know, we'll deploy cash as we have in the last three quarters. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi, good morning. I was wondering, Tim, if you can give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the aerospace business. You mentioned that you're selling everything you can make, but how much better could volumes have looked in that business if you didn't have the capacity constraints? And I guess, what specific actions or how much additional capacity do you think you can unlock as we get into the second half and into 2025? Thanks. Hey, Mike, just to put some scale on it, our backlog, so we produced more, sold more, had record quarter in that business, and yet our backlog still grew. So our backlog is almost $300 million. So whatever you have us down for as margin in that business, if we were completely unconstrained, it would be, that $300 million at our aerospace margins. But going forward from that, there is nothing on the horizon that our customers are telling us that's going to slow that in the near future or midterm, at least. In fact, we're getting forecasts from them that are even higher. So, you know, what we're doing in the short term is, I would call them incremental capacity additions, things you can do quickly, whether it's through productivity improvement or CapEx investments, both of which we're doing. But beyond that, we're assessing, do we need to do something of a larger scale? And when we're ready to talk about that, we'll let you know. But it's pretty significant backlog driven across commercial, general aviation, and military, driven across transparencies, coatings, and sealants, and driven across OEM and aftermarket. Every one of those is getting pulled from our advanced technologies. Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Favre with BMP Paribas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. No. Yes. Good morning, all. And team apologies. France made you events in France. Maybe you miss your forecast, but I've got a question on industrial coatings pricing on the minus 3%. Can you unpack how much of that was indexation? This is the rest. And are you seeing pressure away from indexation given with volumes? And the second part to that question is, should we assume that the indexation part is going to get worse in 2H2, or are we at the trough in terms of the year-on-year impact? Thank you. Hey, Laurent. I'm expecting lots of paint sales as the Olympics get going here, and then after the Olympics as well. So I'm sure France's recovery is on the horizon. You know, the pricing in the industrial segment, virtually all of it is index pricing. You know, I don't want to say 100% because there's always things happening around the edges, but virtually all of it is index pricing. And, you know, I don't expect that to change significantly as we look through the rest of this year. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Estock with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hi, this is Dan Rizzo from Jefferies. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for fitting me in. I was just wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about softness or exports from Chinese auto EVs kind of slowing. I was wondering if there are as of yet, anticipating a change in the environment if Trump were to take office? Like, what's the lead time between they anticipate higher tariffs and potentially lower sales and shutdown or slowdown production? Yeah, so I'll start. And all Trump questions, I delegate to Vince. So I'm going to let Vince handle that part. But what I want to say about the EVs, you know, we're a proud supplier to the number one manufacturer over there. And, of course, they were doing quite a bit of export. And so they're being cautious right now. And we'll see how that plays out as far as their overall production numbers as we move through the year. But I do want to point out, you know, even though, even with all the headlines on EVs happening right now, it may be in a less than positive direction. I think that's only changing the slope of the curve and not the endpoint destination of the curve. For 2024, even with all the news we've heard, the projection is still that EV production will grow by 14% versus last year. And the production is still that 30% of every vehicle produced in China will be an EV And of course, China produces about a third of all the world's cars. So I think we all have to take these headlines as moderation, but not drastically story-changing headlines for EV. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask a couple more questions on North American architectural and the portfolio as well. So on architectural, I think our understanding is, you know, 4% EBITDA margins for the whole group, but maybe the stores business was recently unprofitable. I don't know if that's something you can just shed some light on. And are you seeing any interest in the stores side of that as well? Presumably, you know, we've heard that there's good interest on the non-stores business, but if there isn't on the stores, would you consider kind of keeping those or shutting those down, or how do you proceed there? And then on the portfolio itself, as you look into 25, presumably you won't have architectural in North America, so you will be a little bit more industrial levered. Is there any way you can kind of give us your thoughts on how we should think about that, industrial businesses, encodings sometimes have fetched lower valuations. So I don't know if that enters into your thinking as well. Thanks a lot. Hey, Ryan. Let me answer the North American architectural questions. Again, I think when we announced the strategic review in February, we gave some directional information. And certainly the people who are interested and engaged got the data books, et cetera, and we're providing data. almost on a daily basis. We're not going to get into the nuances of the different channels. Again, we're in a process where there's a lot of folks looking at it. They have what they need, and we're not going to certainly get into how this may or may not be split. Again, there's a multitude of different scenarios that we're entertaining, and we'll let that process play out over the next 60 or 75 days or whatever. So, again, we'll let that process play out, and when we get to an ultimate conclusion, I think we'll be a little more granular to answer some of your questions. And let me take the portfolio question. You know, mathematically, of course, you're spot on that X this business, you know, we will be a little heavier in industrial coatings and a little lighter in performance coatings. But you've seen the – you know, the numbers and the guidance we've given on the profitability and margin of the architectural U.S. business. And X that business mathematically and going forward, despite that shift that you described from, you know, less performance and more industrial, in aggregate, we will be a higher margin and a higher growth company. You know, we wouldn't be doing this otherwise. Just to be clear, there's also the benefit of us as a management team, as a PPG team, being able to focus all resources, whether it's human resources, R&D resources, capital resources, bandwidth resources on businesses that have higher growth and higher margin profiles. So we are fully confident that this is the right thing to do for not only customers and employees, but absolutely for shareholders going forward, fully competent. Your next question comes from the line of J.D. Pandya with On Field Investment Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Thank you. First question is on packaging. Could you just tell us how confident are you to keep the share that you have gained because one of your competitors had a fire because we are hearing sort of opposite messages and, you know, they seem to be confident they'll get the share back. So just wondering, you know, how will packaging look in 2025? My second question is, sorry to come back to architectural North America, but, you know, looking back 10 years ago when you bought the actual business, it doesn't feel like a lot has changed in terms of either the store footprint or the you know, plant footprint or even for that matter, the profitability. And you alluded to one point, which was really our need for investment. So just curious, you know, when you look at JV models, where do you need to invest and how do you sort of unpack and improve profitability here? Because you yourself done it with Axto in the last 10 years. And sorry to say this, but it sort of hasn't worked. So. you know, what would you and a JV partner do here? Just curious. And sorry to squeeze in one more. Tim, you know, volume growth has been an issue for PPG for the last, you know, 11 quarters. How do you incentivize your sales force to go for volume if you at all want to do that? Thanks a lot. Okay, J.D., thanks for the questions there. on packaging, high degree of confidence that we will keep our share gains and continue to grow the share. You know, you did mention an incident one of our competitors unfortunately had. And of course, there was some, you know, some things that the industry did to get through that. But we've won a lot of share that had nothing to do with that incident. And so we are confident going forward that our Our technology is inside the can, outside the can, on the easy open end, our food lines. We're gaining share across a number of different spaces that have nothing to do with that isolated incident. So, you know, good news ahead for that business. Your JV scenario for architectural U.S.-Canada, you know, at the end of the day – You know, I've said from the beginning that we believe this business could be more successful with a partner, and that partner could either buy the whole thing or do a JV. That partner might be able to run more velocity through the high fixed cost that company-owned stores bring. They might be able to bring more velocity through whether it's other paint products or other building products in general. So that is a big issue where a JV may be able to help us from that velocity through your high fixed cost stores. You know, in volume growth, you know, I mentioned as we moved through 2023 and the first half of 2024 that we were modifying incentive comp to drive more organic growth. We've done some of that. Some of that's already in place, and some of it's still being implemented as we speak. And that is one element of a multifaceted recipe that we're changing to drive a higher organic profile company. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Ciaccarelli with Ehrenberg. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Hello, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a very quick one on industrial coating. I would be interested in understanding if you can provide some color around the monthly run rate of volumes. And I would be particularly interested in the exit rate in June if there's any area of the business that actually accelerated or decelerated at the end of the quarter. Thank you. Yep, Arun, thanks for the question. So at the end of the quarter, I would say industrial segment. Automotive was decelerating. As I previously mentioned, we got some further shutdown news as we moved through the month of June. I would say industrial starting to, you know, pretty flat, but we are starting to see some sequential improvement that we projected in the Q3. And I think packaging, you know, basically the last question is accelerating. from a volume standpoint. So that's how I'd quantify the exit rates for industrial segment. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Alex Lopez. Thank you, Elliot. We appreciate your continued interest and confidence in PPE. This concludes our second quarter earnings call. This concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect.
