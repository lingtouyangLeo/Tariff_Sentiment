Our second quarter performance demonstrated once again that our Hungry for More strategy is delivering positive results. For the second straight quarter, we drove U.S. comp performance in the healthiest way possible through profitable order count growth, positive order counts in our delivery business, positive order counts in our carryout business, positive order counts across all income cohorts. We also continued to see improvement in our international comps and generated earnings that were in line with our expectations. As a result of our strong results year to date, and expectations for the back half of the year, we remain on track to achieve our guidance for annual global retail sales growth of 7% or more and operating profit growth of 8% or more. I want to provide an update on our net store growth guidance, which we temporarily suspended this morning. First, I want to reiterate that our U.S. pipeline is strong and it continues to grow. We continue to expect 175 or more net new stores annually in 2024 through 2028 in the US. We now expect to fall below our net store growth target for international in 2024 by approximately 175 to 275 stores, primarily as a result of challenges in both openings and closures faced by Domino's Pizza Enterprises, DPE, one of our master franchisees. We're partnering closely with DPE as they work through this process. Now it's important to note that our largest expected growth markets of China and India remain on track to deliver on their growth potential. In China, DPC Dash announced they'll open store number 1,000 by the end of this year, and then they'll increase their net openings per year to between 300 and 350, starting in 2025. Back in May, Jubilant, our master franchisee based out of India, increased its total store count potential to 5,500 over the medium term in the six global markets in which it operates. When you think that it took Domino's over 60 years to open 5,500 stores in the United States, Jubilant's goal exemplifies the hungry for more mentality our global system is taking on. Now let's look at our second quarter results through the lens of our M-O-R-E, hungry for more pillars, which continue to drive our business. As you know, M stands for the most delicious food. We know we've got the most delicious food in the industry and are focused on showcasing that with more mouthwatering food photography in all of our marketing and our sales channels. We launched our New York-style pizza in Q2, and it's what we call innovation with intent. When we launch a new product, it's got a specific role, and it's intended to stay on the menu permanently. New York-style pizza is another example of that. It's got a crust that's thinner and more foldable than our traditional crust. It was designed to appeal to pizza lovers whose idea of deliciousness is a little bit different than Domino's pizza offerings in the past. The result has been a high mix of sales within our pizza offerings. In addition to being a product that showcases deliciousness in a different way, New York-style pizza is available as part of our mix-and-match offer. Domino's Rewards members can also redeem 60 points for a free medium two-topping New York-style pizza. This new offering drives more than just deliciousness. It drives value, and it drives more customers into our loyalty platform, and that's why we call it Innovation with Intent. The O in Hungry for More stands for operational excellence. This is how we'll deliver on our promise to have the most delicious food, by consistently driving a great experience with our product. As I shared on our last earnings call, in 2024, we're rolling out a new service program we're calling More Delicious Operations. This is a series of three product training sprints focused on our dough, how we build and make our products, and then how we cook them. In Q1, we embarked on our first sprint, which focused on our dough, and are now rolling out our second sprint around ingredients and product builds. These product sprints and last year's Summer of Service are working together with our DomOS technology to drive improvements in our delivery times. In fact, estimated average delivery times were nearly 10% better in Q2 of 2024 than they were in Q2 of 2022. And we're doing all of this while our stores are handling more orders. So I wanted to congratulate our franchisees and operators whose commitment to service allows us to deliver on the promise we're striving to make in our marketing that Domino's has the most delicious food. Our third hungry for more pillar is R for renowned value. And as I've said before, it's not just about having the lowest price in the market. It's about providing value that's innovative and memorable. Renowned value breaks through the sea of seeing this discounts you see in the marketplace. Now, Domino's Rewards is an example of that renowned value. It continues to perform well and was the key driver of our strong U.S. comp performance in Q2. If you recall, our objectives for the program were to drive new users, particularly carryout customers, and increase the frequency of light users. I'm happy to report that Domino's Rewards continues to deliver on those objectives. Our active members are up significantly year-to-date through Q2, showing that the program is continuing to build. Redemptions across both the delivery and carryout channels are also increasing, which is contributing to the transaction growth you're seeing in each of our businesses. For example, in our carryout business, orders with a loyalty redemption in the first half of 2024 are twice as high, 2x, as they were in the first half of 2023 under our old loyalty program. So as Americans continue to look for value, Domino's is providing renowned value and doing it profitably for our franchisees. National promotions are another way we're driving renowned value. In Q2, we had two boost weeks, both of which were very successful in driving transactions and customer acquisition. As it relates to our promotional cadence in 2024, you can continue to expect around six boost weeks. While providing renowned value through our own channels is one part of our barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other. And our launch into this space remains on track to exit the year at 3% or more of sales coming through Uber Eats. Everything we do at Domino's is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisees. They're the E in our Hungry for More strategy. In early May, we hosted our largest worldwide rally with almost 9,000 franchisees and team members in attendance. This year's event was appropriately themed, hungry for more. We brought the strategy to life across our global system and the results showed. This was our most highly rated rally of all time. To close, I couldn't be more energized by the future of Domino's Pizza and seeing the excitement of franchisees at our rally really brought that to life for me and the leadership team. Our results show that our strategy is resonating with customers and our system All of this gives me great confidence that we can continue to drive significant long-term value creation for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn things over to Sandeep. Thank you, Russell, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter financial results were right in line with our expectations. Our strong start to the year has resulted in profit dollar growth versus 2023 for our U.S. franchisees. We remain on track to achieve our target of $170,000 or more average US franchise store profit for 2024. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 7.2% in the quarter due to positive US and international comps and global net store growth. US retail sales increased 6.8% and international retail sales grew 7.7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. During Q2, Same-store sales for the U.S. came in at 4.8%, which was in line with our expectations. Our strong comps in the quarter for carryout of 7.9% and delivery of 2.7% were once again driven primarily by transaction growth. Our U.S. same-store sales continued to be primarily driven by transaction growth from our new loyalty program and our strong marketing programming. We also benefited from 1.5% of pricing, which was inclusive of high single digits in California. Our sales mix from Uber grew to 1.9% for the quarter. The incrementality of Uber sales continues to be in line with our expectations. Our comp tailwinds were partially offset by a higher carryout mix, which carries a lower ticket than delivery. Shifting to U.S. unit count, we added 32 net new stores in line with our expectations. This brings our U.S. system store count to 6,906. We remain on track to achieve our 175 or more net store growth target in the United States in 2024, and we anticipate opening our 7,000th store by the end of the year. Shifting to international, where comp results were generally in line with expectations for the quarter. Same-store sales, excluding foreign currency impact, accelerated to 2.1% in the quarter. The improvement from Q1 was broad-based as we saw improvements in our Europe, Asia, and Middle East markets. Store counts increased by 143 net stores as we finished the quarter with more than 14,000 international stores. Our net store openings were impacted by softness in DPE on gross new store openings and closures. Income from operations increased 1.7% in Q2, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency of $2.7 million. This increase was primarily due to higher franchise royalty revenues resulting from global retail sales growth. This was partially offset by higher G&A, which was primarily driven by higher labor expenses, as well as the company's worldwide rally expense as communicated on our last quarterly call. I expect the return on this expense to be extremely high, as everyone across our system left engaged, inspired, and ready to drive our Hungry for More strategy. Lastly, our margin rate was impacted by 0.3% headwind in Q2, from the tech fee being reduced to 35.5 cents and our ad fund contribution rate increasing back to 6% as previously communicated. Turning to our outlook, we continue to expect 7% or more global retail sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency based on the following key items. Our 2024 U.S. comp to be above the 3% or more long-term guide as a result of catalysts in Uber and loyalty for the full year, and we expect comps to be 3% or more in Q3 and Q4. Specific to Q3, we expect comps to be slightly below what we saw in Q2 on a one-year basis as we're expecting one less boost week, partially offset by a continued ramp in Uber. Second, sales through Uber to increase as marketing and awareness grow, and we're expecting to exit the year with an overall sales mix of 3% or more. Third, international comps to accelerate to 3% or more long-term guidance in the back half of the year. As Russell noted, we now expect to fall below our 1,100 or more net new store number for 2024. This is due to challenges in our international business, primarily related to DPE. As we get further visibility into the full effects of DPE's store opens and closures, we will provide an update on the impact to our long-term outlook for 2025 and beyond. We continue to expect an 8% or more year-over-year increase in operating income, excluding the impact of foreign currency. To highlight some of the components, first, For the year, you can expect operating income margins to be relatively flat compared to 2023 and to be down slightly in Q3. As a reminder, we are not expecting to see cost leverage in 2024, primarily due to investments we are making in consumer technology, store technology, and supply chain capacity to support future sales growth. We are now expecting supply chain margins to expand compared to the prior year due to some favorability in the food basket and slightly higher procurement productivity. We are forecasting to come in below the midpoint of our food basket range of 1 to 3 percent for the year. In Q3, expect supply chain margins to be roughly flat compared to the prior year and down in Q4. The favorability in supply chain margin is being partially offset by pressure within GNA due to slightly higher investment levels. We continue to expect our GNA as a percentage of global retail sales to be approximately 2.4%. And lastly, we are now expecting the impact of foreign currency to be approximately 1% of operating profit dollars in 2024. We expect This will impact our year-over-year operating profit margins by roughly 20 basis points. As was noted in our disclosure this morning, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. We continue to maintain flexibility due to the volatility of the interest rate environment as we evaluate our upcoming debt maturity in October of 2025. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions. Certainly. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, please press star one one on your telephone. Our first question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please. Great morning, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. Wanted to ask a little bit more on the loyalty, what you're seeing there and sort of as we go into the back half of the year. and maybe even into 25, how you guys are thinking about that loyalty program, given the contribution you've seen already this year, and what you're expecting kind of, again, balance of the year, in the year to how you think about marketing it, promoting it. Thank you, guys. Morning, Dennis. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I'll tell you, loyalty for us this year has just been tremendous. If you think about the objectives that we outlined in our investor day, we said with the new loyalty program we wanted to drive Light users and frequency there check we wanted to continue to obviously to to drive our delivery customers Obviously we're doing that but we also want to engage our carry out customers check there So it really is it's doing every single thing that we had hoped it would we'll give a number at the end of the year as far as as new users, but I can tell you that the user the number of new users is is increasing I gave a number in my in my opening remarks that just, to me, is indicative of how this is going. So remember, one of the things we said we were going to do is really use loyalty to drive carryout. So orders from a carryout perspective, orders with loyalty redemptions in the first half of this year are twice as high as they were under the old program in the first half of last year. You know, Sandeep talked about how our carryout business is doing, and this is one of the big reasons. So just really on all of the objectives, the loyalty program is delivering what we had hoped. One thing I'll add to that, Dennis, is we've talked about this previously, but this is a multi-year driver of comps for us. So this year is just the beginning, and as we did in Peace of the Pyre Awards when we launched it in 2014, we saw over three or four years, continuous compounding of comps based on the launch of the program. We expect a similar kind of cadence as we go through this program as well. Yeah, and when you think about the health of this quarter and how order counts came in so strong, all of those customers are going into the flywheel of this loyalty program. So today's orders are really tomorrow's sales, and that's why we're so excited about how the loyalty program is working with everything else that's firing on the business right now. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please. Thank you. Good morning. As it relates to the unit growth guidance, I understand that the shortfall is primarily related to pressures you're witnessing at DPE, but Can you dive into this dynamic a bit more? It just seems like a lot has changed versus when you initiated the long-term outlook at the end of last year. So just trying to better understand how the surprise came about so suddenly versus what you were expecting seven, eight months ago. Yeah, Brian, it's Sandeep. And so I think when you go back to the investor day back in December, I think one of the process that we went through was working with all of our master franchisees. including DP on the expectations that they had for the business. And we basically calibrated to that for both 24 and the five year horizon as well. And at that time we were completely aligned. So then actually we got into the end of the Q1 call and then we got into the second quarter and we started seeing that relative to our expectations and cadence, both new store openings as well as closures really started increasing from from DPE. And as we saw that, we continued to engage with the DPE team to validate the forecast that we had for the year. And it became pretty clear as we actually went through that conversation and discussion that there was not only the risk to the second quarter that we were seeing, but clearly the outlook was going to be impacted as well. And in fact, just yesterday, I think DPE put out a release with with the number of closures that they outlined in the Japan and France market in particular, which they're targeting for their first half, which is our second half, which therefore will land in this fiscal year. So apart from what we've seen in second quarter, we expect to see more pressure in the second half of this year. So I think when you take the collective of all of that, It was a pretty material update that we were going to see in the numbers for this year. And we felt it appropriate to update our guidance for 2024. And also, you will notice the range is 175 to 275. Why is the range that big? Because I think as we go through the process of not just the closures, but the potential openings, the timing of it could potentially shift between our fiscal 24 and fiscal 25. And that's why we're temporarily suspending guidance on the long-term outlook as well, apart from this year. So that's kind of what went on in the background, Brian, so you understand that. But I think one of the things I want to just come back to is when we look at our long-term guide, I mean, we're talking about maintaining our GRS growth of 7% plus and our operating income guide of 8% plus. And the reason for this is the store closures that we're talking about are very low-volume stores. So when you actually put it all together, the aggregate impact to operating income is is really immaterial in the grand scheme of things. And so that's why we're very confident in our operating income guidance. And we are reiterating that as you saw this morning. Yeah, and Brian, I would just add to that. I think what this shows me is how many levers we have to grow this business. And so certainly we're working with DPE, but let me just put some of this in perspective. So our sales and stores are still on target for the 7%, I'm sorry, our sales and profit for the 7% plus and the 8% plus. And with those headwinds in DPE, that means we have a lot of other things firing. And so just maybe I'll start with development. So at the same time as we have this DPE news, we have news that China and India are increasing their outlooks. we've got today 14,000 stores. Half of those stores we've opened since 2015. And so the momentum we have on our way to 40,000 stores, which is a lot more room for us, is tremendous. Then when you think about our development in the U.S., obviously, as Sandeep said in his remarks, 175 plus is still our target this year that we're going to hit. And when you think about the strength of development, openings are really important, so are closings. And in the trailing 12 months in the U.S., we've closed, you know, only seven stores out of a total of about 7,000. And so development, I think, overall is pretty healthy. And like I said, we've got these other things firing at the same time, which is why our sales and profit numbers are still coming in at forecast. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question, please. Hi, good morning. My question is a follow-up, Russell, on your comments about the outlook for the year being unchanged. I guess we've seen signs that consumer spending is slowing, certainly in parts of the restaurant industry, and It feels like the degree of difficulty in the U.S. has increased, so I just wanted to ask you to give some commentary on why you're so confident in holding those targets for this year and whether you think the degree of difficulty is higher or unchanged versus what you were thinking previously. Thanks. Thanks, David. To me, the best predictor of the future, even though I have a lawyer in the room who probably tells me I can't say this, is what's happened. You're right about consumer spending slow, but let's think about what's happened with that as a backdrop. We've grown orders in our delivery business, our carryout business, every income cohort. We haven't talked about international, but we've grown order count in international. That's what's going on in an economy where folks are kind of maybe struggling to decide what to buy. And so if order counts are positive in that scenario, then as the momentum swings eventually, I expect our momentum to continue. So what you do when times are tough, to me that talks about the strength of the brand. And that's why I just could not be more excited about how we delivered the results for the quarter. Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question, please. Great, thank you. Sandeep, you talked about how the 3Q comps in the U.S. are expected to trail 2Q levels, and just given these are comparisons, I'm curious if that reflects what you're observing so far this quarter, or if it's more just forward-looking around your expectation, just given one less boost week in 3Q. Andrew, thanks for the question. I think, no, it's more about what I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is we do have one less boost week. We do have the ramp in Uber, but on a net basis, it's slightly below what we saw in Q2 as our expectation for Q3. But I'll go back to Russell's previous answer. We are seeing tremendous performance in terms of transaction growth for the entire first half, and we're expecting to see that same performance in the entire second half. And so we're very confident in the ability of our business to deliver the kind of momentum that you've seen already in the first half, in the back half, including Q3. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore. Your question, please. Thanks. Good morning. I guess the question is about, I'll make it kind of a two-parter, It looks like the sales trends are pretty volatile in the U.S. from the data that we see. For example, things looked like they were weaker in April when you didn't have sort of a value-forward message like emergency pizza or the $3 tip. Could you kind of reflect on the quarter and what you're seeing in terms of the consumer response to stuff and maybe give us a sense of what you think is working and not working today in the u.s and then separately i think people are going to be concerned about the fourth quarter if the third quarter is worse than this quarter maybe you know let's say you do a four percent in the third quarter i think people are going to be concerned about you holding that three percent plus in the fourth quarter given the comparison so maybe you can address both of those thanks yeah sure i'll maybe i'll give it a shot and sandy if i miss anything As far as the volatility in the short term, I think we look at quarters, not days, and obviously years as well. There's always some bounciness based on everything from weather to what we put out there. I like the second part of your question, which is kind of big picture, what's working and what's not working. What's working is the hungry for more strategy. I'll give you an example maybe using one of the things we are doing this year as we talked about was we're going to launch two new products. So we just launched the New York style pizza. New York style pizza is all about the most delicious food. It's an innovation with intent. There are, believe it or not, some people out there who don't love our traditional crust. So this is an incremental crust, more foldable, hopefully bring new people in the fold. At the same time, that new product is delivered in better delivery times than it was two years ago. That's operational excellence. It's part of our mix and match promotion. It's also part of our loyalty program, Renown Value. And so what we're doing, David, is really tethering all these things together. There's never anything that's firing one cylinder on its own. There truly is a domino effect of connectivity between all the programs we have going on right now from a not working perspective I mean we're always hungry for more that's that's that's kind of the bumper sticker of this company but I've been here 15 16 years and I know what drives the business its orders its stores its market share and the orders that you've seen the stores that you're seeing Just think about what traditional growth has been for the pizza category. We are going to be big winners from a share perspective. And once you do that, everything grows. Your franchisee profitability grows. Your advertising fund grows. You get a moat. And our moat is filled right now with orders and stores and franchisee profits. David, I'll just tag on, just clarifying a couple of the points. I mean, you talked about volatility in sales trends in the U.S. We didn't see any volatility. We saw a very steady cadence. And the steady cadence of sales is really driven by the flywheel that Russell talked about and the loyalty program and the frequency that's continuing to build from there. We've seen that pretty consistently across the year, frankly, including the second quarter. So we don't see the volatility at all. And I think the other question that you asked was the confidence in the Q4 comp. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect both Q3 and Q4 to be above the 3%. But we just explained that Q3 may be slightly below Q2 because of the timing of the number of boost weeks offset by Uber's ramp. Now going to Q4, one of the things we talked about earlier was that loyalty is going to be a multi-year driver for us. So sure, we're lapping in Q4 the loyalty program launch, but we still expect to be seeing tailwinds and the compounding impact from the loyalty program in Q4. In addition, Uber continues to build. And so with both those drivers, there's every case to look at 3% or more is very, very much within reach in the fourth quarter, and we're always hungry for more. So the more we do, the better it is. So we're really confident, and because this is all transaction-driven, it's really driving very strong economics. So franchisee profitability continues to grow, and I think that's actually driven by a significant performance on the supply chain side also, which you're seeing on the supply chain financials that's going into the franchisee profits. So overall, very confident of our outlook for the back half of the year. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silverman from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the value strategy. You talked about the one boost week in the third quarter that leads to, I believe, one in the fourth quarter. Clearly, you're driving strong performance. Given the value focus in the industry, what flexibility do you have to further increase promotional activity? And then are you seeing any increase in value mix and how much is going through deals? Yeah, Lauren, thanks for the question. I think what we're doing in value is very special, and it's very different than what you're seeing in the industry right now, which I think, folks, it's clear that there's been price taken, and folks are dealing back kind of individual items, telling customers, hey, this is what you can get on value. What we've done, and we've done this since 2009 when we launched Mix and Match, our Mix and Match offer values two things. Values the price, but it's the price for what you want. If the price for what you want is high and the price for something you don't want is not high, that doesn't really do much. And so when you think about all of our platforms, you think about pizza, you think about pasta, sandwiches, desserts, salads, breads, chickens, all of those things, consistently have been part of our promotional value play since the end of 2009. And having that consistency, when people wake up in the morning and decide where they want to order, they know that they can trust Domino's. That trusted value is leading to the order count you're seeing, and then they become part of that loyalty flywheel. And so I just, I think it's important to make sure we explain our approach to value is not just price. It's about price for what people actually, you know, want to order. And that's, as you've seen over this time period, a very sustainable way to grow. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Frankfurt from Guggenheim. Your question, please. Hey, Russ, I love the domino effect reference there. The, but, I just had a question on the incrementality of Uber and just some of the commentary there. I think you've had it in for about nine months. Can you talk about what you've learned and maybe how you're changing some of the marketing message over the last maybe three or six months? And then any update on thoughts on DoorDash in the next year? Should we still expect something on that and maybe what the timing would look like? Thanks. Thanks, Greg, and we're going to send you the domino effect bumper sticker after this, so you want to look out for that. Uber is performing as we thought it would. It's doing so in a little bit of a different way, and I talked about it last quarter, but I think it's worth bringing up again. First, from a sales perspective, it's about 1.9% sales, and we're tracking towards our goal this year of 3% of sales. How it's coming is a little bit different. What we've seen is really an uptick more in a high-low strategy. Originally, you know, our approach was, okay, if we have kind of an everyday low price, not compared to our channels, right, still the lowest price, lowest program on our channel, that would be the way to win. But actually, whether it's how customers shop or part of the algorithm or a little bit of both, starting out with a slightly higher price that you can discount from is a way to get more eyeballs, and so we've continued to test and pivot that way, and you're seeing it in the results. So again, the year is folding like we thought it would, and so what that leaves us with, your question about DoorDash, is the current exclusivity with Uber runs through Q1, At that point, whether or not we renew is our choice, and so we'll be looking at the economics and potential at that point. But that would be the time to think about do we stay exclusive or do we open up to a DoorDash or other aggregators. We've talked about the billion-dollar opportunity for us is really our fair share on all of the aggregators, which in about three years or so is what we hope to get to. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivanco from JP Morgan. Your question, please. Hi, thank you. You know, it's especially in the context of closures in France and in Japan. I ask about impacts of store splits in the U.S. You're currently at around a two and a half percent store growth rate in the U.S., which is actually high for a fairly mature brand. So Talk about what you see as net, I guess, cannibalization, whatever you want to call it, what negative impact on same-store sales from store splits. And is there any learning on, I guess, either side of the Atlantic or either side of the Pacific, as it may be, in terms of who is learning from who in terms of how markets can be penetrated? Is it? that they didn't necessarily follow the same site model that you do? Do you have any opportunities to kind of look at them in terms of how densely markets can be penetrated? I just want to, I guess, have a sense of your level of risk acceptance in terms of hitting your U.S. store targets without overly encroaching on your existing current asset base. Thank you. Yeah, John, I'll take that. And maybe I'd start with the fact that I remember when we used to actually disclose what headwinds of splits were. So the fact that we're not disclosing them anymore can give you a sense of how material they are. The great thing about the Domino's model and us leaning into carryout about a decade ago is 80% when you split a store, 80% of the carryout volume is incremental. And so, you know, that right away when you're splitting a territory, you're getting all these customers. Look, customers, they don't want to drive past four pizza places on their way to a Domino's. And so the more Domino's we have, the more carryout business we drive. And you can see how on fire carryout is. The number that Sandeep took you through was same store sales for carryout. That has nothing to do with all the carryout sales were driving from new stores. And then what happens when you split these stores, not only does your carryout business get better, but remember I talked earlier about our delivery times being 10% better than they were two years ago? Sure, it's a lot of the programs that we're driving with our franchisees, but it's also when you split stores, you get closer to your customers. And when you have more consistent delivery, those customers come back more. So it really is a... wonderful cycle when it's when it's really going well and actually one what I'd say is because you'd asked about international learnings one that DPE was one of the first folks to do in Australia you know they got a 50 market share in in Australia Australia and a lot of it was through you know penetration with new stores and obviously tightening their delivery areas growing their carryout business what they talked about that they saw in Japan was they probably split a little too fast. But doing it strategically over time has been a winning formula. They've shown it, and I think that's been a huge driver of our market share. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Senator from Bank of America. Your question, please. Thank you. I have actually sort of one just clarification and then a question on the new restaurant growth. So if the clarification was just quickly on the pricing versus cost inflation and whether franchisees are seeing something similar, obviously you're still on track for the franchisee profitability targets, but pretty modest pricing increase that clearly didn't cover inflation for labor insurance. Is that kind of the dynamic that we should expect to see broadly going forward? Or was there any, anything kind of one time in this quarter, that, you know, specifically, perhaps around insurance, but then the question on on on net restaurant growth is about, you mentioned, you know, strengthen in in China and India, could you just maybe in broad strokes, talk about what volumes look like in different parts of the world. So you know, a closure in Australia presumably is, you know, a higher volume or, let's say, a lack of openings in Australia, more of a hit to volumes for retail sales overall than perhaps openings in China and India. I mean, that would be my guess, but perhaps that's not accurate. Thanks. So, Sarah, let me start with the clarification on pricing versus cost inflation. I think you're talking about the corporate stores particularly. And really, if you look at what happened in the corporate stores, And we had an insurance charge in the quarter that actually resulted in margins contracting. And if you actually strip out that insurance charge, margins were roughly flat and profit dollars grew. And really speaking, when we look at our franchisee profitability, that's pretty much a dynamic. We're looking at profit dollar growth, and that's exactly what we're expecting to see. And frankly, we expect to see that in corporate stores as well as we actually go through the year. We continue to expect to see both margin improvement as well as profit dollar growth on the corporate stores as well. And then I think specific to restaurant growth in China and India and your comment on the size of the stores, the closures that we're talking about essentially are very low volume stores. So from that perspective, I think they're not necessarily comparable to the averages across all the different markets. And so I think the drag is relatively small. with the closures that we're talking about specifically in Japan and France. And the growth opportunities continue to be robust. And the China stores, they've actually put out releases talking about their new store openings and the kind of record sales they're generating over there. So very exciting to see the growth coming from China. And I'd add to that, Sarah, for us, and I think really for the industry, when you think about the best way to cover cost inflation, assuming margins are in the area of where they should be, the best way to do that is by driving order count versus price. And so cost inflation for some folks may be a negative thing. For us, given our scale, because we can drive more order counts, if we can get away with doing that without pricing and getting frequency, we're going to do that all day, and that's what's happened. And I just want to give a nod to our insights team because one of the questions earlier was about pricing in this environment right now and headwinds with the customer. Well, through our research, we figured out when it was time to take price, and we also figured out when it was time not to take price. And all of those decisions are what's leading into the results you see now, and it will continue to drive what we decide to do moving forward. Now the best piece of it too is, you know, the research, a lot of it is, is, you know, it's, it's numbers, but then it gets translated to real life when you, when you put it down to the stores. And then what you do is you watch what consumers do and you watch what your franchisees do. And what's been great is obviously the order counts. So consumers are happy, but franchisees are sticking with the recommendations, not only obviously on our national offer, but local offers and, and, and, uh, and menu pricing. And so this is something that I think is proprietary for us and has worked and will continue to work over time. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please. I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on what you think, at least in your view, what is causing the soft medicine unit opening by DPE? And more specifically also, if you can share, what is your level of confidence that international store openings and closure pressures is going to be limited only to DPE and that we're not going to see another potential reduction in the guidance later on with other master franchises coming in software versus the original expectation? Thank you. Yeah, Danilo, I'll let DPE's release kind of speak to what they're thinking about those closures. So they talked about Japan being a little bit aggressive in openings, and now they're seeing kind of the results of that. What gives me confidence about the rest of the piece of the algorithm is, you know, as an example, I said earlier, DBZ China, Dash, and Jubilant they're going to be 40 to 50% of our openings and they each increased their outlook. And so the beauty of being in over 90 countries around the world is look, I'm not, I'm not trying to look away from what clearly was a miss on one part of the business, but a good business is able to kind of handle that. And that's what being in 90 plus markets helps us do. And all of these levers that, and end up leading to the 7% plus on the sales basis and the 8% plus on the profit basis really show how that is made up in times like this. Anything to add? No, that's all right. Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please. Yeah, great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the, you know, you guys mentioned positive order counts in both delivery and carry out in the U.S. Can you just talk a little bit about are these new customers, are these lapsed users, and just any thoughts on that? call it lower income consumer. Are you seeing, I know you said you were seeing growth across all income cohorts, but any thoughts on what you're seeing there? Is that accelerating? Is it stable? I guess that's my first question. And just to follow up on that, on the store closures from DPE, Sandeep, you said they're very low volume. Is there any way to give us an order of magnitude of how low these stores are in terms of volumes, just so that we understand? Thank you very much. Yeah, maybe Sandeep, the other way to look at that is to talk about the profit impact. Yeah, I think, so on this, let me start with the second part of the question, right, which is the store volumes and what's going to happen. Very low volume in relative terms to the rest of the fleet and rest of the market in all the stores that are closing in Japan and France. So the impact is so immaterial to the profit number, it's in a few million dollars on a forward basis. for 2025 and will have a very limited impact even on 2024, considering we're only halfway through the year. So, very small to answer your question from that piece. Yeah, and Peter, just on the first question, you know, what I'd say about the order count, and I try to stress this by giving the specifics of delivery and carry out in every income segment. is we've got some of the most balanced order count I've ever seen. And I believe that's also true for the, not only in our history, but also just in the industry right now. Your specific question on the lower income customer, yeah, the order count there is positive as well. And part of that was intent, not only from our pricing, but as we put the loyalty program together. Remember, you used to have to have Two things. You had to buy $10 worth of food to get any points. Now it's $5, so that hurdle's a little bit easier. You used to have to buy six times to get something free. Now you can get something free after two orders, which is great for the customer, actually great for a franchisee, too, because the margin on the 20- and 30-point items is much better on those orders than the 60. So it's not like we just kind of fell into this. This was intent in both the design of our pricing, and the design of our loyalty program, and it's not going away. And the beautiful thing, Pete, is it's so balanced across all income cohorts, and I think it really reflects what Russell's talking about, and that consistency has been seen all through the first half of the year. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Call from Stiefel. Your question, please. Yeah, good morning, guys. Russell, just given the success of the New York-style pizza, can you talk more about this innovation with intent strategy? And it's just part of that answer. Can you maybe touch on whether the innovation you expect to launch later this year will leverage that approach? Yeah, sure, Chris. Well, I'll tell you the one thing that did not drive New York-style pizza was the guy in the spot, which for those of you who don't know was me. Sandeep keeps telling me I have a face for radio, so we'll see when it's time for your performance review, how that works out. But yeah, so New York-style piece of this idea of innovation with intent, if you look back the last 15, 16 years at Domino's, there are, I can't think of more than two items, products that we've launched that we've taken off the menu. Launching a new product takes a lot of money, takes a lot of time. And so there needs to be a strategic role in it. Whether or not you are successful is whether or not those items are still there. So you think about, I'm not going to really give you any forward looking other to say, you know, we're going to continue to do two a year. New York style pizza, right? We talked about this is a customer that may not like our traditional crust as much. So there's a reason for doing it. If you think about what we did last year with pepperoni stuffed cheesy bread, okay, putting pepperoni in something is probably not the most innovative thing in the world. But guess what? It reminded people that we had stuffed cheesy bread. And when you have all of these platforms, and remember, Chris, 40% of what we sell is not pizza. You've got to figure out a way to continue to talk about pizza but continue to remind people that you have these platforms. And so, you know, maybe those are two – good examples of intent. One is going after a customer that probably doesn't frequent Domino's. And the other is reminding people of a platform that when they add to their order, it increases ticket and is more profitable for our franchisees. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harper from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. If I could just follow up on some of the comments about store margins. So if you kind of set aside that insurance impact, I mean, is this mostly just about there being still pretty significant wage inflation? Do you think that's kind of the case through the balance of this year? Obviously, you did have order count growth, right? But it sounds like that's kind of being offset on the labor side. And I don't know if maybe there's any sort of product mix dynamics that have also affected that. Could you just talk more about know the store margin dynamic yeah so so brian i think the thing of these uh the company stores is essentially it's a much smaller data set right because we've only got about 60 mas in which we're operating and and yes there was some wage pressure that we were actually dealing with as we went to the first time but we were getting closer to lapping some of those the wage pressures that we that we took and overall when you look at um the economics of the stores they actually on a first half basis still pretty good and definitely the insurance adjustment still expanding and growing. We expect that to continue to happen. That's why I said for the full year on the company stores I still expect our margins to be better and our profit dollars to grow. And I think being, what I want to emphasize is we shouldn't view company stores as an analog to what's happening on the franchisee stores because the data set is so limited in relative terms. On the franchisee stores, we're seeing very, very balanced profit growth across the business, and that's what gives us confidence that the $170,000 or more is definitely on track. Yeah, I'll just maybe build on that. The question on the lap just reminds me of an earlier question we had about Q4 and emergency pizza and how we're going to lap that potential headwind. And I guess what I'd say there is we are in the business of creating headwinds. I love the questions on headwinds, because that means we did something really successful that folks are wondering, oh, how are we going to overlap? Well, we're in the business of creating headwinds and we're in the business of beating those headwinds. And so I'm not concerned about that. And I know what the team has going and they're up for the challenge. And if you think about emergency pizza, during this time now where you are seeing a lot of price out there from folks, I think, you know, who has what price point is going to be, as I always talk about at CSA, how are you going to know when an ad is over, you know, who owned this particular price point? Everyone in the country knows who owns emergency pizza. And so we have things like that, carry out tips, you tip, we tip, that's renowned value. And so there are, As you see more and more discounts to customers, as I think different restaurants are adjusting to pricing, I believe there's going to be a lot of noise in that. And what our team does really breaks through that noise. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Brooks from The Benchmark Company. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on loyalty. Sandeep, I think when you talked about loyalty last quarter that you talked about the 20 and 40 point reward tiers being the majority of redemptions. Wanted to see if that trend is continuing to go going forward and with enough time passing, do you have a sense that somebody that redeems at a lower point level tends to continue to do so? So it's a almost a faster frequency flywheel coming from loyalty if those customers stick at those lower redemption tiers. Thank you. So, Todd, you asked the question and answered it yourself. And really, it's exactly that. We have been seeing very consistent trends in terms of the redemption of the 20 and 40 point levels. And it is driving that frequency flywheel as we go along because they're continuing to transact and redeem. And And that's what we're very confident on continuing as we move forward into a multi-year flywheel. Yeah, and back to the question before, Todd, that reminds me of the innovation with intent. Innovation with intent is not just new products. It's a loyalty program and how you put your renowned value together. So with emergency pizza, if you recall, you buy a pizza, you can get a free one in a month. Well, you do that, all of a sudden you're part of our loyalty program. You're at 20 points, you're getting a free item. With our tipping program, either carryout or delivery one, if you buy one, you're part of the program. You then use your tip. You've got a second item if you're part of the loyalty program, and you're redeeming. The most important thing about our new loyalty program is getting people to understand how easy it is to earn. And the programs that we're putting out there aren't just driving sales. They're driving that clarity for folks about, wow, I can get stuff really quick. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Hi, thank you. So I know you have just had the Worldwide Rally in May, so really curious to hear your some of your key takes from the event. What were any surprises? What were the areas that your franchisees around the world are most excited about, most worried about? Any common strategic priorities that have come up there? It would be great. Thank you. Yeah, Christine, this was a fantastic rally. It's not just me saying it. I'll give you some numbers on it. We do quantitative studies on everything here at Domino's. We do it on a rally. It was the highest rally we've ever had as far as people. But the scores of attendees, we've never had a higher one. And this one blew my mind. I'll get you on that later if I'm sharing something I shouldn't. But one of the things we ask people is, did you take away the key message? And the results there were 98%. took away a key message. We've never had numbers anywhere like that. And the cool thing was people were leaving the rally. You know, a lot of times you do these rallies and whatever they're called, you know, like the bumper sticker, you know, we're going to send out earlier. It really is more, what does the T-shirt look like? Or what do people shout? Hungry for More was more than that. Folks came away knowing what jobs they needed to do. And so the really cool part for me were, for example, the us franchisees leaving and saying, I got it. I'm responsible for the M and the O making sure the food, we make it delicious and we deliver it the right way. We had international franchisees saying, ah, this idea of renowned value is really, really interesting. And what happened? We went back and, you know, you've seen changes in the marketing and in a lot of our international markets, um, because of, of hungry for more. And so I believe it not only talks about the strength of our system, it's nice to have profitable franchisees all in one place, they're all pretty happy, but when they come away talking about the future is what makes us really excited. Thank you, Christine. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you all again soon. You may now disconnect. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.
