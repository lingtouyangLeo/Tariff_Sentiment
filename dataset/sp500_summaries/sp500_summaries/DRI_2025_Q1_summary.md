- Industry/Macro backdrop (per management/Black Box Casual Dining):
  - Industry same-restaurant sales -2.5% and guest counts -5.4% in the quarter
  - July saw an unexpected industry-wide step-down (weather events, Olympics distraction with highest opening ceremony ratings in over a decade, uptick in COVID, shift to outbound international travel, political volatility)

- Guidance: FY25 outlook reaffirmed
  - Management expects mid-to-high single-digit EPS growth each of the next three quarters; calendar shift noted (Thanksgiving in Q3)
  - Pricing contemplated around 2.5–3% per quarter; commodity inflation guided “~2%” now trending a bit better; chicken cost headwind expected in 2H; labor inflation ~4%

Management Commentary
- First-party delivery with Uber Direct (Olive Garden):
  - Two-year exclusive; pilot ~100 stores in 2Q, pause through holidays, phased rollout to all OG curbside locations by FY-end
  - Ordering through OG website/app; same menu pricing for dine-in, pickup, delivery
  - Transparent delivery fee paid by guest (~$5 + 5% of order; tip shared with OG to-go specialists); protects restaurant economics and guest experience
  - Capacity management tool limits operational disruption; Darden retains guest data; potential expansion to other brands later
- Menu and product innovation:
  - Olive Garden: Bringing back Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo and Stuffed Chicken Marsala (reworked for quality and simpler execution)
  - LongHorn: New lemon garlic chicken (healthier option; strong guest scores) and a top-selling dragon fruit margarita using exclusive Patrón Reposado
  - Yard House: New higher-quality pizza platform (half the cook time), plus improved cheesesteaks and half-pound prime burgers
  - Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen: Value-forward LTOs (e.g., two pork chops starting at $12.99), onion rings return; lunch specials starting at $8.59; leveraging “opportunity buys”
- Marketing and pricing strategy:
  - Olive Garden shifting to more price-point-forward advertising (vs equity-heavy last year); NEPB pulled forward and extended to 12 weeks (price unchanged for 3 years), with a new garlic herb sauce mid-promo
  - Connected TV extending beyond OG to LongHorn, Yard House, Cheddar’s; digital marketing proving efficient
  - Long-term posture: price below competitors and below inflation; OG pricing ~800 bps below full-service peers and ~700 bps below grocery inflation over 5 years
- Operations and service:
  - Renewed focus on pace-of-meal to capture quicker occasions without rushing; leveraging scheduling analytics and a 3-year tech roadmap; no major staffing increases anticipated
  - Ongoing facility refresh: ~$200k per restaurant annually
  - Yard House “Best on Tap” bartender recertification elevates bar execution/atmosphere

Q&A Highlights
- Uber Direct details:
  - Not advertising on Uber’s marketplace; Uber to provide some marketing funds; Darden to leverage OG e-club (17M+ members) and digital channels
  - Delivery fees (~$5 + 5%) create parity with pickup margins; accounting nuance may affect P&L geography but not economics
  - Full menu parity for food; alcohol excluded; large-party catering remains separate (team-delivered/set-up service)
  - OG off-premise mix mid-20%; ~80% small order, ~20% catering; >60% of to-go already digital
- Sales cadence:
  - June similar to F4Q trends; July fell off sharply; August rebounded to flat; early September positive comps across segments except fine dining
  - LongHorn trends healthy; steak category benefiting from grocery price dynamics and fine-dining trade-down
- Olive Garden demand/promo color:
  - Traffic softness tied to fewer first-time/infrequent users; Darden data indicates OG not losing share to deep discounters; rather, discounting peers taking from other discounters
  - NEPB preference slightly higher YoY; 60–65% of NEPB guests add protein (trade-up mix higher YoY)
  - Extended NEPB expected to taper near the end as it laps last year’s later launch; OG also restored Create-Your-Own Pasta to $12.99, lifting preference
- Cost/pricing outlook:
  - FY pricing likely in 2.5–3% range by quarter; commodities slightly better than initial plan (watch 2H chicken); labor inflation ~4% with rising applicant flow
- Fine dining:
  - Urban units at mid-70% of pre-COVID; suburban in 90s; aspirational guests and <$200k income cohorts pulled back; focusing on brand-right offerings (e.g., Capital Grille “Wagyu & Wine”) rather than discounting
- Regional/operational drivers:
  - Florida and Texas softer (travel/weather); Houston hurricane impact; store-level differences primarily tied to execution/management effectiveness

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends:
  - Value sensitivity elevated; steak category benefiting from at-home risk avoidance and trade-down from fine dining
  - Delivery convenience is stickier than previously assumed; Darden entering via first-party model to protect economics and data
- Cost outlook:
  - Commodities improving modestly vs start of year; specific 2H chicken risk
  - Labor pressure moderating with healthier applicant flow; productivity initiatives ongoing
- Capital allocation:
  - Reaffirmed FY guide; ongoing dividends and repurchases
  - Acquisition integration talent in place; maintaining industry-leading margins and cash generation
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - July’s step-down was a notable negative surprise; Uber Direct partnership and an earlier, longer NEPB constituted key strategic responses

Takeaways
- Guidance reaffirmed; early 2Q comps positive ex fine dining; margin structure remains best-in-class despite July softness.
- Olive Garden is leaning into value communication (extended NEPB, explicit price points) and first-party delivery to reaccelerate visits while avoiding deep discounting.
- LongHorn continues to gain meaningful share on strong execution, favorable beef costs, and category tailwinds.
- Cost environment improving modestly; commodity inflation now likely below the ~2% guide, but 2H chicken is a watch item; labor inflation manageable at ~4%.
- Uber Direct is structured to protect unit economics, operations, and data; expect gradual, incremental off-premise lift with optionality to expand to other brands.
