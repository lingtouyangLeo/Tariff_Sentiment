- Fees/NII:
  - Net card fees: record; +20% YoY (FX-adjusted); more than doubled since 2019; spend retention ~98%.
  - Net interest income: double-digit growth; since 2019, a bit over half of NII growth from volumes, rest from margin (better risk pricing, more lending features incl. charge-to-lend, and deposit growth).
- Expenses/capital/margins:
  - Variable Customer Engagement (VCE) grew slightly faster than revenue; marketing up mid-single digits.
  - Opex ex-‘Certify’ +9% YoY (risk management and technology investments); expect full-year opex growth mid-single digits ex-‘Certify’.

  - CET1 10.6% (target 10–11%); SCB 2.5% (lowest allowed) per CCAR.

  - YTD through Q2: +9% revenue growth (FX-adjusted) and $7.71 EPS.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/product:
  - Upcoming U.S. Consumer and Business Platinum refresh in fall; same playbook: materially increase delivered value, with potential fee increase; numerous world-class partners; benefits expected to “substantially” exceed fee.
  - Recent refreshes (U.S. Consumer Gold, Delta, Hilton) drove double-digit account growth; portfolio revenues +30%+, card fees +60%+; minimal change in 98% spend retention; improved credit mix.
  - Premium leadership pillars: global premium customer scale, partner-funded value, experiences (Resy/restaurant access, largest lounge network incl. 30 Centurion lounges and Delta lounges), and superior service.
- Competitive landscape:
  - Premium space highly competitive for a decade; management confident Amex wins on value-for-fee, breadth of benefits, customer service, partner network, and disciplined refresh cadence.
- International:
  - Sustained double-digit growth; focus on five large markets and key cities; accelerating merchant acceptance; premium products often priced higher than U.S.; nascent SMB opportunity abroad.
- SMB:
  - SMB spending more cautious (inventory/restraint) but segment revenue, lending, fee businesses and credit remain strong; expects billings to improve with macro clarity.
- Co-brand portfolios:
  - Amazon and Lowe’s co-brand portfolios exited due to economics; both remain important accepting merchants; minimal expected impact to SMB segment results.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Spend outlook: Planning for continued stability; G&S resilient; T&E pockets softer; new card origination (3.1M total; ~1.5M U.S. consumer) supports billings trajectory.
- Premium competition and pricing power: Competition expands category; pricing power tied to value delivered; Amex runs independent refresh schedule, not reactive; “may the best company win.”
- Platinum refresh P&L timing: Card Member Services costs step up at launch (likely Q4); fee uplift phases in as renewals occur and is recognized over 12 months; full economic benefit realized over up to ~2 years; already embedded in guidance.
- Net card fees outlook: Growth rate to moderate in H2’25; Platinum refresh benefits mostly in 2026.
- VCE/discount/rewards dynamic: Don’t over-index on a single revenue line; VCE ratio is an outcome of product-level optimization; premium products carry higher VCE but deliver value via lower marketing, better credit, and higher lifetime value; expect VCE ratio to trend slightly higher over time with premium mix.
- Lounges/crowding: Addressing via larger lounges, expansions, satellite concepts (e.g., LAS “sidecar”), and coordination with Delta; continued innovation.
- Acquisition economics: Competition has increased consideration for premium; Amex deploying more marketing dollars at attractive ROI; ~70% of new cards fee-paying; mix broadly stable.
- International acceptance: Ongoing multi-year merchant expansion; strong growth; low share implies long runway.
- Stablecoins/Coinbase: Sees role for stablecoins in cross-border and SMB payments as an ACH/SWIFT alternative; Amex/peers likely to be key off-ramps; partnership with Coinbase enables off-ramp and crypto rewards; not a replacement for card rails; monitoring regulation and potential SMB-focused entry.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Demand steady; category expansion in premium continues.
  - Costs: Expect Card Member Services to rise with Platinum refresh; opex growth mid-single digits ex-‘Certify’; VCE ratio to drift up with premium mix.
  - Capital allocation: Ongoing repurchases/dividends within 10–11% CET1 target; SCB at 2.5% offers flexibility.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Guidance reaffirmation despite softer airline/lodging; strong credit and fee momentum.
  - Explicit disclosure of new cards by segment; transparent discussion on VCE dynamics and NII drivers since 2019.

6) Takeaways
- Premium engine intact: Record revenue, strong EPS, robust fee growth, and best-in-class credit underscore the resilience of Amex’s premium-led model.
- Competitive refresh coming: Fall Platinum relaunch should enhance value; near-term P&L shows earlier cost recognition with fee benefits lagging—largely modeled in guidance.
- Spend steady but mixed: Overall spend and transactions healthy; T&E pockets softer; G&S and restaurants resilient; international double-digit growth.
- Strong balance sheet and returns: CET1 10.6%, SCB 2.5%, ROE 36%, and ongoing capital return.
- Risks: Macro uncertainty (reserve build), T&E softness, premium competition, lounge capacity, and timing gap between refresh costs and fee recognition.
