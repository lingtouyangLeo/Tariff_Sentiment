Quarter & Company Context
- Company: IDEX Corporation (NYSE: IEX)
- Period: Q2 2024 (three months ended June 30, 2024)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Industrial daily order rates stable and consistent with original 2024 assumptions.
  - Broad project approval delays (not cancellations) tied to higher-for-longer rates/inflation uncertainty and U.S. election-related caution.
  - Semiconductor recovery expected to accelerate in 2025; late-Q2 push-outs occurred.
  - Life Sciences/Analytical Instrumentation (LS/AI) markets remain pressured; management does not expect positive inflection until 2025.
  - Municipal water activity strong; agriculture cyclical downturn; auto/industrial softness affecting certain products.

Headline Financial Results
- Orders: $773M, +1% reported, +2% organic.
- Sales: $807M, -5% reported, -4% organic.
- Margins:
  - Adjusted gross margin: 45.4% (+70 bps YoY).
  - Adjusted EBITDA margin: 27.8% (-60 bps YoY; +180 bps QoQ).
- EPS:
  - GAAP EPS: $1.86.
  - Adjusted EPS: $2.06 (down $0.12 YoY).
- Cash flow:
  - Free cash flow: $118M (-2% YoY); 75% conversion of adjusted net income (+310 bps YoY).
  - Management confident in >100% FCF conversion for FY24 on inventory reductions.
- Segment highlights:
  - FMT: Orders -4% organic; sales flat; water strong; ag weak; project push-outs.
  - HST: Orders +5% organic; sales -11% organic; LS/AI weakness; semicon not yet inflecting.
  - FSDP: Orders +6% organic; sales +1% organic; fire OEM improving; emerging-market dispensing wins; BAND-IT impacted by auto/industrial softness.
- Guidance:
  - Q3 2024: Organic sales +0–1%; adjusted EBITDA margin ~27%; GAAP EPS $1.61–$1.66; adjusted EPS $1.85–$1.90. YoY: FMT low-single-digit growth; HST and FSDP low-single-digit declines.
  - FY2024 (revised): Revenue -1% to -2% (prior 0% to +2%); adjusted EBITDA margin ~27% (prior ~28%); GAAP EPS $6.85–$6.95 (prior $7.13–$7.43); adjusted EPS $7.80–$7.90 (prior $8.15–$8.45). Implies mid-single-digit organic decline in HST; low-single-digit growth in FMT and FSDP.

Management Commentary
- Strategy and portfolio:
  - Acquired Mott Corporation (sintered porous materials and flow control; complements HST applied materials science). Expected strong organic growth, EBITDA margin above HST average, and near-term EPS accretion.
  - Acquired Subterra (digitizing underground infrastructure) for FMT’s intelligent water platform.
  - Divested Alfa Valvole for $45.5M to optimize portfolio.
  - Continued application of IDEX Operating Model and 80/20 to drive growth/margins and resource reallocation.
- Innovation/product updates:
  - MP350 Microlizer (Materials Processing Technology) won Biotech Innovation Award; supports vaccine/viral vector manufacturing.
  - Melles Griot X-Plan CCG lens series launched (prototype-to-production scaling).
  - EPEC Verisight Ultra intelligent water inspection solution launched.
  - Trebor Quantum XNT heaters approved for wafer fabs; significant ultra-pure water savings.
  - Wildcat control solution for wildland fire brush trucks.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Project spending delays in FMT and HST; LS/AI demand softness; late semicon deferrals; mix headwinds and lower volume leverage; higher employee-related costs.

Q&A Highlights
- Guide change drivers: Stable daily rates but increased project push-outs and lack of expected semicon launch activity; no cancellations.
- Recovery curve: Potential for sharper uptick once rate/election uncertainties resolve; semicon likely strong in 2025; LS/AI appears at/near trough with innovation pipelines building; 2024 trend largely flat.
- Free cash flow: High confidence in >100% FY conversion via inventory reductions aligned to lower top line.
- FSDP orders: Growth driven by North America fire OEM demand; dispensing EM orders can be lumpy.
- Pricing: ~+2% price in Q2; price-cost spread +100 bps (high end of 80–100 bps FY target).
- Book-to-bill: 0.96 in Q2 vs 1.02 in Q1 (fewer blanket orders); expect seasonal blanket activity in Q4 to set up 2025.
- Backlog: Normalized to ~half a quarter of coverage; no unusual cancellations.
- Spending: Discretionary down in HST and FSDP; higher in FMT for front-end digitization. Growth investments (people/domain expertise) maintained.
- Exit-4Q margin view (EBITDA): HST ~28%; FMT ~34%; FSDP 28–29%.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand outlook: Orders expected to improve sequentially in H2; Q4 book-to-bill seen as key indicator for 2025 setup.
- End-market trends: Municipal/industrial water has multi-year runway; fire OEMs clearing backlogs; ag and auto/industrial softer; semicon customers signaling 2025 ramps; LS/AI innovation and trial activity encouraging.
- Cost/pricing: Continued positive price-cost spread; mix and labor inflation remain watch items; 80/20 driving productivity and complexity reduction.
- Capital allocation: Active M&A with strategic fit and accretion (Mott, Subterra); dividend continuity; modest debt paydown.
- Surprises vs expectations: Q2 EBITDA and EPS slightly above prior guidance; negative surprise from late-quarter semicon push-outs; notable positive from Mott acquisition.

Takeaways
- Stable consumptive demand but broader project approval delays drove a cut to FY revenue/EPS outlook; management views semicon and LS/AI recoveries as primarily 2025 events.
- Execution strong on costs and pricing: gross margin expanded YoY; sequential EBITDA margin improved 180 bps; segment exit margins targeted to improve by year-end.
- Cash generation resilient with >100% FY24 FCF conversion targeted; balance sheet supports ongoing M&A and dividend payments.
- Mixed end-market picture: water and fire healthy; ag and auto/industrial soft; HST orders positive but sales still down as LS/AI remains sluggish.
- Strategy intact: Continued build-out of HST applied materials science; Mott expected to add growth, margin accretion, and near-term EPS lift.

Other Notable Information
- 119th consecutive quarterly dividend; $52.2M paid in Q2.
- Repaid $25M on term facility during the quarter.
- Effective tax rate 21.2% (benefit from international R&D incentive resolution).
- Management acknowledged recent guidance variability (largely in HST) but reaffirmed long-term conviction in HST investments and positioning.
