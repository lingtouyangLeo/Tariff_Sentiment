- Context:
  - Inflation across core merchandise essentially flat; fresh foods ~0%, slight inflation in food & sundries, deflation in non-foods (hardware, sporting goods, furniture) aided by lower freight.
  - Consumers showing renewed appetite for discretionary categories; dining out softening, more meals at home benefiting fresh.

    - Core merchandise margin: flat (+2 bps ex gas); core-on-core +10 bps (non-foods strength, fresh intentionally lower).

Management Commentary
- Merchandising and Categories:
  - Non-foods led comps (toys, tires, lawn & garden, health & beauty; home furnishings rebounding). Big/bulky items performing (e.g., $1,200 swing set).
  - Fresh momentum; bakery “reinvented” with new items (KS lemon blueberry loaf, morning buns).
  - Ancillary: Food court strongest; new chocolate chip cookie performing well.
  - Price investments: Ongoing, embedded in model; notable price reductions (e.g., KS pine nuts $29.99→$24.99; KS frozen shrimp -$1).
  - Kirkland Signature: New men’s walking shoe and facial wipes performing well; private label targets ~20% value vs. national brands.
- Digital and Logistics:
  - E-commerce growth led by gold/silver bullion, gift cards, appliances.
  - Costco Logistics deliveries +28% (appliances nearly +30%); bundled delivery/installation/haul-away a differentiator.
  - Costco Next (curated marketplace) added 8 vendors; total 75; used to expand assortment and test items.
  - App downloads +32% YoY (~2.5M in quarter; total >35M); site traffic +16%; AOV +8%.
  - Expanding BOPIS to more categories (e.g., TVs, electronics) within operational limits.
  - Exploring personalization carefully while preserving the “treasure hunt”; focus on awareness of local warehouse activity, app functionality, and linking warehouse inventory visibility.
- Pricing/Inflation:
  - Overall pricing stable; continuing to pass through cost declines to members as fast as possible.
- Membership Fee:
  - Increase remains a “when, not if”; beyond historical 5-year cadence but timing still under evaluation. Any increase would be reinvested to widen member value.
- Expansion and Capex:
  - Opened 2 U.S. warehouses in Q3; since Q3: Loomis, CA and Nanjing (7th in China).
  - FY24 plan: 30 total openings (incl. 1 relocation; net +29): remaining 12 (9 U.S., 2 Japan, 1 Korea).
  - Capex: ~$1.06B in Q3; FY24 $4.3–$4.5B.
- Technology and Data:
  - Retail media and data monetization seen as significant runway; unique due to membership model and SKU discipline. Majority of economics expected to be reinvested into member value. IT spend to support, within normal capex trajectory.
  - Throughput initiatives: Testing front-door scanning of membership and items to speed checkout; infills and gas expansions to ease parking/throughput constraints.

Q&A Highlights
- Membership fee increase: No change in philosophy; timing TBD; purpose is to reinvest in member value.
- U.S. unit growth: Sustainable 25–30 opens/year for “foreseeable future,” at least half in U.S.; infills boost frequency and renewals; cannibalization well-modeled; example Toronto build-back in ~6 months.
- Competitive pricing: No need for special price actions; Costco is highly competitive daily; appliances promotions in market offset by Costco Logistics value proposition.
- Margin framework: 14–15% gross margin ceiling remains intact; any alternative profit streams (media, data, payments, travel) largely reinvested (“~90% back to member” mindset).
- SG&A trajectory: Strong leverage from productivity; management sees continued runway (no hard target).
- Gas: Gallons +5%; profitability down YoY (headwind to ancillary margins); overall gross margin flat ex-gas due to core and e-comm.
- Vertical integration: Case-by-case to ensure value/supply (meat, optical labs, chicken plant). No new initiatives to announce.
- Delivery partners: Instacart remains; expanded Uber Eats (all Canada + 17 U.S. states; planned expansion to several international markets). Uber partnership also enables Uber gift cards and discounted Uber One for members.
- China: 2-hour same-day grocery delivery in 6 clubs (7th starting), positive incremental shops.
- Personalization: Use judiciously to enhance, not dilute treasure hunt; biggest opportunity is localized awareness, app improvements, warehouse-online integration.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Discretionary improving; consumables/fresh remain strong as at-home eating grows; gold/silver interest evident online.
- Costs/Inflation: Flat overall; non-food deflation persists; freight favorable YoY; LIFO credits continue.
- Capital allocation: Elevated but stable capex; tech priority without outsized spend.
- Expansion: Healthy U.S. runway and international growth (notably China, Japan, Korea).
- Surprise elements: E-commerce +20.7% with bullion/gift cards/appliances; Costco Logistics +28% deliveries; gas profit down; explicit note that Q4 has fewer weeks than LY.

Takeaways
- Broad-based strength: Comps +6.6% with traffic +6.1%; e-commerce +20.7% led by bullion and appliances; discretionary categories re-accelerating.
- Margin discipline intact: Gross margin up YoY on lapping, core-on-core +10 bps; gas profit a headwind but offset by e-comm; SG&A leveraged despite wage increases.
- Membership engine strong: Fee income +7.6%; renewals at record levels; exec members growing and driving mix; fee increase still “when, not if.”
- Growth runway: 25–30 new clubs/year sustainable; significant U.S. infill opportunity plus international expansion, notably China; capex $4.3–$4.5B.
- Digital/logistics momentum: App engagement rising; Costco Logistics and curated marketplace (Costco Next) expanding member value; careful personalization while preserving treasure hunt.

Other Notable Information
- Investor relations: New quarterly slide deck (including “matrices”) will be standard.
- Upcoming cadence: May sales (4 weeks) to be reported June 5; FY24 Q4 is 16 weeks vs. 17 LY (creates a reported comparison headwind).
- Operational initiatives: Front-door scanning pilots to increase checkout speed; ongoing gas station expansions; continued price cuts on select items.
- Food court: Continued strength; $1.50 hot dog price explicitly reaffirmed as “safe.”
- Partnerships: Expanded Uber relationship includes selling Uber gift cards globally and discounted Uber One memberships for Costco members.
- Costco Logistics: Serves only Costco orders (legacy Sears minimal and excluded from reported growth).
