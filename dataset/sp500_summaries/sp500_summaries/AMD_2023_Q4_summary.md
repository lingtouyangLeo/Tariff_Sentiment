  - Client to grow; PC TAM to grow modestly, weighted to 2H as AI PCs ramp

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and products:
  - Data Center CPUs: Continued EPYC share gains; strong Genoa/Bergamo demand; Sienna traction; Turin (Zen 5) launching later in 2024 as drop-in replacement with higher cores, better efficiency, and memory expansion.
  - Data Center GPUs: MI300X (AI) and MI300A (HPC) ramping; Q4 data center GPU revenue exceeded the $400M expectation due to faster MI300X ramp. Significant cloud (Microsoft, Oracle, Meta) and enterprise engagements; OEM platforms from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro launching.
  - Software: ROCm 6 released with major GenAI performance improvements; strong ecosystem progress (Microsoft brought GPT-4 up on MI300X; Azure MI300 previews; Hugging Face enablement; OpenAI Triton collaboration).
  - Client/AI PC: Ryzen 8000 mobile and 8000G desktop with integrated NPU; AI PC leadership claims (Ryzen powers >90% of AI-enabled PCs in market); next-gen Strix (Zen 5 + enhanced RDNA + updated NPU) with >3x AI perf vs 7040, launching later this year.
  - Gaming: Radeon 7000 growth; RX 7600 XT launched; FSR 3 introduced; semi-custom (consoles) entering year 5, decline expected.
  - Embedded: New Versal Prime and automotive Versal SoCs; Ryzen Embedded for industrial/edge; >$10B of design wins in 2023 (+25% YoY).
- Risks/Challenges:
  - Mixed server market in 1H24 (cloud optimization, cautious enterprise)
  - Embedded inventory digestion through 1H24
  - Console cycle maturity; gaming revenue headwinds
  - China headwinds noted
  - Supply tightness in 1H24 (AI accelerators), easing in 2H

4) Q&A Highlights
- MI300 ramp and outlook:
  - Q4 data center GPU revenue “over $400M”; Q1 sequential growth; revenue to increase each quarter in 2024, more 2H-weighted.
  - 2024 MI300 revenue raised to >$3.5B based on firm customer orders; supply chain capacity secured for “substantially more” in 2H if demand warrants.
  - Exit-4Q24 MI300 quarterly run-rate of ~$1.5B is possible.
  - Use cases include both training and LLM inference; MI300X value prop includes higher memory bandwidth/capacity enabling fewer GPUs per workload and system TCO savings; competitive on perf/$.
  - Software progress: ROCm 6, direct optimization with top clouds, open-source momentum (Hugging Face, Triton).
- Server CPU market:
  - Traditional server demand still mixed in 1H24; refresh cycles beginning; AMD expects growth in 2024 and continued share gains; significant enterprise under-penetration remains; Turin (Zen 5) in 2H.
  - GPU spending crowding out CPU: AMD expects CPU market to grow in 2024; timing depends on macro and capex trends; strong refresh value proposition.
- TAM and competitive dynamics:
  - $400B 2027 AI accelerator TAM refers to accelerator chips (GPUs/ASICs) including attached memory; not systems; growth driven by strong unit growth and rising content (memory, advanced nodes).
  - Competition: MI300 competitive for training and notably strong for inference; customer engagements are multi-generational. NVIDIA’s future parts acknowledged; AMD focused on accelerated roadmap.
  - Foundry/process: Confident in TSMC partnership; even with process parity, AMD sees architectural and product portfolio advantages. Intel’s progress noted; AMD emphasizes design and system-level innovation.
- Revenue modeling and supply:
  - Raised MI300 2024 guidance reflects stronger demand, not pull-forward; customers moving from pilots to volume; strong order book.
  - First-half capacity tight; more capacity in 2H; aim to increase supply beyond current >$3.5B outlook.
- Margins:
  - Q1 GM guided up to 52% (+120 bps QoQ) on mix (Data Center up, Embedded down).
  - 2024 GM expansion expected, with tailwinds from Data Center mix, embedded recovery in 2H, MI300 test/yield improvements; headwind from Embedded softness in 1H.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Strong and accelerating AI accelerator demand; fastest revenue ramp in AMD history for MI300.
  - Data Center GPU revenue to grow each quarter in 2024; broader multi-year AI adoption expected.
  - Client: AI PC ramp in 2H; modest PC TAM growth for 2024.
  - Embedded: Bottoming in 1H; recovery in 2H; strong design-win pipeline supports longer-term growth.
  - Gaming: Semi-custom decline significant for 2024 due to console cycle maturity and normalized inventories.
- Capital allocation:
  - Continued buybacks; ample authorization remaining; investing in R&D and go-to-market to capture AI opportunity; aim for EPS growth faster than revenue via operating leverage.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: Raised 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook to >$3.5B (from >$2B), with solid supply secured.
  - Tone: High confidence on AI roadmaps and share gains; cautious on Embedded/Gaming near term; pragmatic on mixed server demand in 1H.

6) Takeaways
- AI-led acceleration: MI300X/A ramp is ahead of plan; 2024 DC GPU revenue raised to >$3.5B with sequential growth each quarter; supply capacity secured for upside in 2H.
- CPUs still growing: Despite mixed 1H server backdrop, AMD sees 2024 growth and share gains in EPYC; Turin (Zen 5) in 2H should extend leadership; enterprise under-penetration a long-run opportunity.
- Margin expansion: Mix shift to Data Center, embedded recovery in 2H, and MI300 manufacturing improvements support gross margin expansion in 2024; Q1 GM guided to 52%.
- Near-term headwinds: Embedded soft through 1H (inventory digestion); Gaming (semi-custom) down significant double-digit in 2024 as console cycle matures; seasonal Q1 declines in Client and Gaming.
- Software and ecosystem progress: ROCm 6, hyperscaler optimizations, and open-source partnerships materially de-risk AI GPU adoption; customer deployments span both training and LLM inference.
