- NII and deposits
  - Q1 NII outperformance driven by deposit balances and markets; Q2 seasonal headwinds (wealth tax payments, markets NII)
  - Consumer deposits viewed near “floor”; wealth and global banking showing normalizing growth; rate cuts fewer than prior expectations would be a tailwind

- AOCI/hedging and duration
  - AFS portfolio largely hedged; limited AOCI sensitivity to long-end rate moves; balanced asset sensitivity corridor has narrowed
