# Analysis: OXY_2024_Q2.txt

*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Occidental Petroleum (Occidental, “Oxy”); Ticker: OXY
- Period: Q2 2024
- Macro/industry context mentioned:
  - Permian gas takeaway set to expand as the Matterhorn pipeline enters service, likely reducing regional pricing dislocations and gas marketing upside.
  - OxyChem facing softer macro: weaker China demand and delayed interest rate cuts.
  - Gulf of Mexico (GOM) guidance incorporates potential tropical weather downtime.
  - Strong investor demand for Oxy’s recent bond issuance; ratings affirmations support balance sheet strategy.
  - Growing corporate demand for carbon removal (Microsoft DAC CDR offtake).

2) Headline Financial Results
- EPS: $1.03 per diluted share (both adjusted and reported).
- Free cash flow: ~$1.3B before working capital.
- Production: Highest quarterly production in 4 years for Total Company and U.S. Onshore; above midpoint of guidance.
- Cost/margins:
  - U.S. onshore LOE down >$0.60/boe (~6%) vs. average of prior three quarters.
  - Unconventional well costs ~10% lower YTD vs. 1H23.
- Segment updates/guidance:
  - Production (FY24): Including CrownRock from Aug 1, midpoint raised from ~1.25 mmboe/d to ~1.32 mmboe/d. Ex-CrownRock, Oxy maintains full-year total and Permian guidance despite an expected 15 mboe/d 4Q impact from Barilla Draw sale.
  - Midstream & Marketing: Q2 adjusted pre-tax income >$180M above guidance midpoint; full-year segment guidance raised by $220M; expects more muted 3Q as takeaway expands (Matterhorn).
  - OxyChem: Full-year guidance revised down to $1.0–$1.1B given macro softness; still a strong year by historical standards.
  - Capital: 2024 total company capex increased to $6.8–$7.0B to include maintaining CrownRock’s five-rig program; legacy Oxy activity tapers in 2H.
- Balance sheet/debt:
  - Issued $5B senior notes (3, 5, long-7, 10, 30 years) at a weighted average coupon <5.5%.
  - Debt reduction: Retired $0.4B in July; by end of Aug, total repayments expected ~$2.3B (incl. early redemption of CrownRock notes); with Barilla Draw proceeds, >$3B by end of 3Q—~70% of near-term $4.5B reduction goal.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and portfolio:
  - Closed CrownRock (Aug 1): adds high-margin barrels, low breakeven inventory, and scale in the Midland Basin; expected to improve operating costs and compete immediately for capital.
  - Divestiture program ($4.5–$6B within 18 months of close) progressing: ~$970M closed/announced YTD (incl. ~$818M Barilla Draw sale); proceeds to debt reduction.
  - Not a “fire sale”: management stresses selective monetization to high-grade the portfolio and bring forward value.
- Operations and efficiency:
  - Continued focus on time-to-market acceleration in 2H24; secondary bench development remains a strength.
  - Cost initiatives: better FRAC utilization, lower NPT, facilities optimization; artificial lift optimization cutting failures and maintenance; Delaware Basin water recycling doubled vs. 1H23.
- Low Carbon (LCV/DAC):
  - Stratos DAC on track for startup next summer; Microsoft to purchase 500k t CDR credits over six years (largest DAC CDR deal to date).
  - Carbon Engineering R&D yielding line-of-sight to cost reductions; strong vendor engagement (e.g., Technip Energies).
  - King Ranch CO2 sequestration hub in South Texas positioned for scale (30 Mt/yr hub), with Class VI permitting and stratigraphic work underway.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Asset sales/deleveraging:
  - Market interest is strong; Oxy avoids naming targets to protect value. Confident in meeting debt targets; principal debt goal ≤$15B by end-2026/early-2027.
- CrownRock integration and outlook:
  - 2024 program inherited; 170 mboe/d potential still targeted but timing pushed out due to early-year weather downtime and well mix (shallower zones, tighter spacing, shorter laterals) designed for longer-term optimization.
  - Synergies expected via scale (rig/frac utilization), time-to-market gains, water management, and shared best practices. CrownRock capex run-rate ~midpoint $950M with five rigs; likely to maintain activity into 2025 and “do more with less.”
- Rockies:
  - Strong DJ and PRB results; PRB activity pauses in 2H to refine multi-bench development plan for 2025; steady DJ activity continues.
- GOM:
  - Tiebacks advancing (Ocotillo to Marlin; Tiberias to Lucius; ~3.5–8 mile tiebacks) toward FID; OBN seismic unlocked a 15 kb/d well in May and more potential; waterflood project designs progressing for execution next year.
- OFS costs:
  - Seeing >10% deflation (since last summer through YE) in drilling/completions basket; OCTG deflation even higher; efficiency gains from e-fleets, AutoFrac, and better utilization. CrownRock scale should amplify benefits.
- Ecopetrol JV:
  - Proposed 30% undivided interest in CrownRock fell through due to Colombian government non-approval; Rodeo JV area rights remain. Current Rodeo JV production ~40 kb/d net to Oxy; if JV ended, interests would split 51% Oxy/49% Ecopetrol.
- Capital returns:
  - Dividend up >22% earlier this year; share repurchases to resume after net debt reaches $15B. Potential preferred redemption would depend on macro and internal thresholds; preferred becomes callable at a lower premium in 2029.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Production trajectory improving into 2H24 across domestic assets; Q3 ex-CrownRock poised for a four-year high.
  - Cost outlook positive: LOE trending lower; well cost deflation YTD with more efficiency gains expected; midstream normalization post-Matterhorn.
  - Capital allocation: prioritize deleveraging; selective divestitures; maintain CrownRock rig program; balanced approach to buybacks and preferred once leverage target achieved.
  - DAC demand building; Stratos progress and R&D underpin confidence in future FIDs.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Midstream outperformance vs. guidance; full-year uplift.
  - OxyChem guidance trimmed on macro.
  - More cautious near-term CrownRock volume cadence, though longer-term potential intact.
  - >$3B debt reduction by 3Q-end earlier than expected.

6) Takeaways
- Portfolio upgraded: CrownRock adds scale, high-margin barrels, and top-tier Midland inventory; integration aimed at cost, efficiency, and time-to-market synergies.
- Strong execution and cash generation: Record production in 4 years, $1.3B FCF before working capital, LOE and well costs improving; 2024 production outlook raised with CrownRock.
- Balance sheet momentum: >$3B debt reduction expected by end-3Q; on track for ≥$4.5B near-term target; IG status affirmed.
- Normalizing midstream, softer OxyChem: Marketing tailwinds likely abate post-Matterhorn; OxyChem outlook reduced on macro softness.
- LCV credibility rising: Stratos on schedule; Microsoft offtake underscores CDR demand; R&D and hub strategy support future cost-down and scale.

7) Other Notable Information
- Water stewardship milestones: 50MM bbl recycled at Midland South Curtis Ranch; >150MM bbl recycled in New Mexico since 2019.
- Working capital timing: Q2 negative WC due to higher volumes, barrels on the water at quarter-end, and Rockies property tax payments (two-year lag).
- Matterhorn timing: Expected mid-to-late 3Q startup.
- Dividend framework: “Sustainable and growing” dividend is foundational; buybacks to follow leverage milestone; Berkshire preferred callable at lower premium starting 2029.
