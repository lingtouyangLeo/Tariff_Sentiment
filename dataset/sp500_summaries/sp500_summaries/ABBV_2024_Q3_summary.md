Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV); Fiscal Q3 2024
- Context: Management highlighted robust execution across commercial and R&D, continued double‑digit growth from the ex‑Humira portfolio, and seamless integration of Cerevel Therapeutics. Macro headwinds persist in Aesthetics (notably China; U.S. consumer cautious on higher‑ticket filler procedures). Neuroscience pipeline expanded via M&A/BD (Cerevel, Aliada; expanded Gedeon Richter collaboration).

Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: ~$14.5B, +4.9% operational YoY (FX -1.1%)
- Adjusted EPS: $3.00, $0.10 above guidance midpoint (includes -$0.04 acquired IPR&D)
- Margins: Adjusted operating margin 46.7%; gross margin 84.4%; R&D 14.2%; SG&A 23.0%; tax rate 16.2%; net interest expense $591M
- Ex‑Humira platform: ~18% reported growth; represents >80% of total sales
- FY24 Guidance (raised for the third time in 2024):
  - Revenue: ~$56B (↑ $500M; +$1.8B since Feb)
  - Adjusted EPS: $10.90–$10.94 (↑ $0.15); excludes future acquired IPR&D
  - FX impact: -0.7% on full-year sales
- Q4 Outlook: Revenue approaching $14.8B; adjusted EPS $2.94–$2.98; FX neutral

Management Commentary
- Commercial performance highlights:
  - Immunology revenue >$7B, +4.8% op. Skyrizi $3.2B (+51.5% op); Rinvoq $1.6B (+47.4% op). Strong IBD momentum (Crohn’s and early UC uptake), plus psoriasis/psoriatic disease share gains. Raising FY sales guidance for both.
  - Humira $2.2B (-36.5% op). U.S. share erosion in line; more Humira volume than expected moving to novel MoAs (benefiting Skyrizi/Rinvoq).
  - Oncology ~ $1.7B: Imbruvica $828M (-8.8%) amid CLL competition; Venclexta $677M (+18.2%) with EU guideline tailwinds (combo with BTKs) and AML leadership. Elahere and Epkinly launches progressing well.
  - Neuroscience >$2.3B (+16% op): Vraylar $875M (+16.6%); oral CGRPs (Ubrelvy + Qulipta) $445M (+~22%); Botox Therapeutic $848M. U.S. approval of Vyalev (subcutaneous levodopa-carbidopa) for advanced Parkinson’s.
  - Aesthetics >$1.2B (+1.8% op): U.S. +3.9% with Botox Cosmetic $414M (+6.5%); Juvederm U.S. $105M; International -1.6% (China weak). FDA approval for Botox Cosmetic in platysma bands; China approval for masseter prominence. Short‑acting “Bonti” toxin on track for filing around year-end; expected U.S. launch 2026.
- Strategic/Capital allocation:
  - Dividend raised 5.8% to $1.64/sh starting Feb 2025 (>300% increase since inception).
  - FCF >$11B YTD (incl. ~$1.5B Skyrizi royalty payments). Cash $7.3B (Sep), ~$7B 2024 maturities being repaid; target net leverage ~2x by end 2026.
  - Active BD: closed Cerevel; acquired Aliada (anti‑pGlu Aβ with BBB‑crossing tech); expanded Gedeon Richter collaboration; >12 early-stage deals YTD.

Q&A Highlights
- 2025 Outlook: Management affirmed confidence in returning to robust mid‑single‑digit top‑ and bottom‑line growth. Mix shift from Humira to Skyrizi/Rinvoq viewed as net positive; oncology and neuroscience also contributing.
- Payer/Contracting (2025): Access for Skyrizi/Rinvoq expected to remain broad with modest low single‑digit rebate headwinds; contracting nearly complete.
- Immunology competition:
  - Head‑to‑head plans: Skyrizi vs Sotyktu (psoriasis) ongoing; planning Skyrizi vs Entyvio (UC) targeting superiority on endoscopic outcomes.
  - TL1A and combination strategy: AbbVie sees dual‑mechanism combos (e.g., Skyrizi + TL1A or α4β7; inclusion of IL‑1α/β bispecific ludicizumab) as next‑gen efficacy step‑ups in IBD.
- Imraclidine (schizophrenia; Cerevel asset): Two pivotal readouts expected in Q4. Management contrasts profile favorably versus the newly approved competitive mAChR therapy (once‑daily dosing, no food effect, no hepatic monitoring anticipated, lower GI/anticholinergic burden seen to date). Press release timing may combine trials if close.
- Aesthetics LT guide (>$9B by 2029): Still achievable with market recovery to high‑single‑digit growth and Bonti driving expansion/share gains; reassessment likely post‑2026 if needed.
- Eye Care: Remains a strategic pillar (one of five core growth areas) though a smaller contributor near term; BD remains focused on core TAs but open to differentiated, opportunistic entries (e.g., metabolic) if value‑creating.
- Vraylar: FY guidance reduced modestly (-$100M) due to channel mix; offset within neuroscience by higher Botox Therapeutic.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident. Multiple guidance raises, dividend hike, and strong ex‑Humira growth support visibility into 2025 and beyond.
- Demand trends: Strong across Immunology (IBD ramp), Neuroscience (Vraylar, CGRPs, Botox Therapeutic), and steady U.S. Aesthetics (Botox) despite softer fillers; China Aesthetics remains challenged.
- Costs/Pricing: Expect modest pricing pressure (low single-digit rebates) for Skyrizi/Rinvoq in 2025; overall margin profile remains strong.
- Capital allocation: Balanced—dividend growth, deleveraging, and continued BD to seed 2030s growth.
- Surprises vs expectations: Larger‑than‑expected Humira molecule shift to novel MoAs (negative for Humira, positive for Skyrizi/Rinvoq); oncology better than internal expectations (Venclexta momentum; earlier Elahere contribution); aesthetics moderated (Juvederm) due to macro.

R&D and Pipeline Updates (select)
- Immunology: Phase 2 Crohn’s platform study (Skyrizi combos with IL‑1α/β bispecific and α4β7; more to come). Strong UC/Crohn’s data underpin head‑to‑head strategy.
- Oncology: FDA submission for Teliso‑V (c‑MET ADC) in NSCLC; ABBV‑400 (next‑gen c‑MET ADC) early data promising with high ORRs—moving to Phase 2 in NSCLC/GE cancers; Phase 3 in late‑line CRC starting this year. Epkinly EU approval in FL; Elahere positive EU CHMP in PROC.
- Neuroscience: Vyalev U.S. approval; Tevapidon Phase 3 positive in early PD (TEMPO‑1), additional readouts ahead; Imraclidine pivotal schizophrenia readouts in Q4. Aliada anti‑Aβ asset offers deeper CNS exposure, extended half‑life, potential SC dosing and lower ARIA risk; broader CNS delivery platform potential.
- Aesthetics: FDA approval for Botox Cosmetic in platysma bands (first for toxins); China approval in masseter prominence. Bonti filing around YE24, potential market‑expanding launch in 2026.

Takeaways
- Ex‑Humira engine accelerating: Skyrizi and Rinvoq are outgrowing expectations (combined FY24 now >$17B) and absorbing Humira volume, supporting a return to robust mid‑single‑digit growth in 2025.
- Guidance up again: FY24 revenue to ~$56B and EPS to $10.90–$10.94; dividend raised 5.8%, underscoring confidence.
- Pipeline catalysts near term: Imraclidine pivotal schizophrenia data in Q4; Teliso‑V PDUFA 1H25; multiple oncology ADCs advancing; Parkinson’s franchise expanding (Vyalev launch; tevapidon progress).
- Aesthetics mixed: U.S. Botox solid; Juvederm pressured by macro (China/US inventory caution). LT target (> $9B by 2029) still in play but hinges on market recovery and 2026 Bonti launch.
- Risks/uncertainties: Humira erosion mix shift dynamics, U.S./China consumer health in Aesthetics, competitive pressures in CLL, and pending readouts (imraclidine) that could shape Neuroscience trajectory.
