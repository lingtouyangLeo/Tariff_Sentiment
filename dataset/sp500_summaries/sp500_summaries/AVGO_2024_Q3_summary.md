3) Management Commentary
- Strategic/Operational:
  - VMware: Strong execution on VCF-led subscription transition
    - Q3 VCF bookings: >15M CPU cores; >80% of VMware bookings
    - Annualized booking value (ABV): $2.5B, +32% QoQ
    - VMware operating expense reduced to ~$1.3B from ~$1.6B QoQ; on track to achieve or exceed $8.5B adjusted EBITDA target in FY25 (ahead of original 3-year goal)
  - AI Semiconductors:
    - Hyperscaler-focused strategy; minimal enterprise AI exposure
    - Three meaningful custom AI accelerator customers now in production
    - Expect sustained strong AI growth into FY25; able to meet upside order pull-ins (no current supply constraint flagged)
    - Long-term view: hyperscalers increasingly shift to custom accelerators (XPUs); Broadcom positioned across accelerators and AI networking
  - Non-AI Semiconductors:
    - Bottom passed; bookings for non-AI semi up ~20% in Q3; sequential recovery continuing into Q4 and 2025
- Product/Market Updates:
  - Networking (55% of semi revenue): $4.0B, +43% YoY
    - Custom AI accelerators +3.5x YoY
    - Ethernet switching (Tomahawk 5, Jericho 3-AI) >4x YoY
    - Optical lasers/diodes +3x; PCIe switches >2x
    - Shipping 5nm 400G NICs and 800G DSPs
    - Non-AI networking +17% QoQ, -41% YoY; to sustain in Q4; YoY decline moderates to ~-30%; total networking to grow >40% YoY in Q4
  - Server/Storage connectivity: $861M, +5% QoQ, -25% YoY; Q4 mid-high single-digit QoQ growth, high single-digit YoY decline
  - Wireless: $1.7B, +1% YoY; Q4 +>20% QoQ, flat YoY (North American flagship cycle)
  - Broadband: $557M, -49% YoY; Q4 >-40% YoY; recovery expected in 2025
  - Industrial resales: $164M, -31% YoY; Q4 sequential recovery; ~-20% YoY
- Other Strategic Notes:
  - Seagate HDD SoC assets: collaboration to advance nearline HDD to 30–50TB within ~5 years; underscores belief in HDD sustainability for hyperscalers
  - Not pursuing new M&A near-term; focus on VMware transformation
  - Participation in NVIDIA ecosystem limited to enabling components (e.g., optics/DSP); not directly participating in Blackwell compute

4) Q&A Highlights
- AI Mix/Trajectory:
  - Q3 AI ~$3.1B; mix ~2/3 compute, ~1/3 networking; similar mix expected in Q4
  - FY25: Not guiding, but expects strong AI growth; backlog supports near-term visibility
  - Broadcom’s AI growth path tied to hyperscaler custom XPUs and AI networking; not exposed to enterprise AI shifts
- Demand vs Supply:
  - Seeing upside order pull-ins for XPUs/networking; Broadcom indicates it can meet upside (no stated supply constraints)
- Non-AI Recovery:
  - Management confident cyclical bottom is behind; expects recovery through Q4 and into 2025; suggests potential for an upcycle as AI drives broader IT hardware refresh
- Software/VMware:
  - Non-VMware software stabilizing around ~$2B/quarter; Brocade noted as volatile
  - Software gross margins targeted around ~90%; focus more on operating/EBITDA margin
  - VMware profitability ramp visible from disclosed revenue and opex
- Taxes/Debt:
  - ~$4B tax charge from IP relocation is largely non-cash; unrelated to asset sales; ongoing interest expense and Section 174 impact FCF conversion
- Competitive/Industry:
  - Long-term pivot by hyperscalers to custom accelerators expected to accelerate; Broadcom “flipped” view to expect significant XPU adoption at scale
  - Not directly exposed to NVIDIA’s compute roadmaps; will support with enabling components where applicable

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on AI momentum and VMware transformation; constructive on non-AI cyclical recovery; candid on broadband weakness and mix-driven margin impacts.
- Forward-Looking Commentary:
  - AI: FY24 raised to ~$12B; strong FY25 implied, with more customer ramps and pull-ins likely
  - Non-AI semis: Recovery building; bookings improving; potential AI-driven refresh across servers/storage/networking
  - Software: VCF-led bookings accelerating into Q4 and likely through 2025; VMware EBITDA goal pulled forward to FY25
  - Capital allocation: Deleveraging ongoing; dividend maintained; no near-term M&A appetite
- Surprises vs Expectations:
  - AI revenue raised to ~$12B for FY24
  - Strong VCF bookings (>80% of VMware bookings) and ABV growth (+32% QoQ)
  - Q4 revenue guide strong (+51% YoY) with elevated EBITDA margin (~64%)

6) Takeaways
- AI engine remains powerful: Q4 AI >$3.5B (+~10% QoQ); FY24 AI guide raised to ~$12B. Broadcom is firmly leveraged to hyperscaler custom XPUs and AI networking, with increasing customer breadth (three meaningful XPU customers in production).
- VMware transformation ahead of schedule: Rapid pivot to VCF subscriptions with strong bookings/ABV growth; opex down sharply; tracking to achieve or exceed $8.5B VMware EBITDA in FY25.
- Non-AI semis likely past the trough: Bookings up ~20% in Q3; sequential improvement broad-based (ex-broadband); management sees potential for a stronger-than-typical upcycle as AI spurs broader IT hardware refresh.
- Mix pressures margins near term: Q4 GM expected down ~100 bps QoQ on higher semi and AI accelerator mix; FCF conversion impacted by higher interest expense and Section 174 cash taxes.
- Risk balance: Concentration in hyperscaler AI spend and broadband weakness remain watch items; however, order visibility, supply capability, and software execution underpin a constructive FY24 exit and FY25 setup.
