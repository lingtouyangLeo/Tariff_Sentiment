  - Capital returns: Dividend payout ~45% of earnings; share repurchases $4.0–$4.5B
  - Labor cost: All-in cost per employee +~4%
  - Mix/volume: Anticipate soft macro, tough international intermodal comps in 2H25; coal down but less than 2024; domestic intermodal growth; auto volumes improve as year progresses

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and execution
  - Focus on safety, service, and operational excellence; operating with buffer resources (people, locomotives, cars) to protect service amid surges/weather
  - Record workforce productivity; record terminal dwell; sixth straight quarter of longer Train Length; car velocity up modestly
  - Safety improved: lower derailment and personal injury rates
- Commercial highlights
  - Bulk: Coal down; new LCRA coal contract partially offsets retirements; grain steady domestically; grain products strong on renewable diesel feedstocks
  - Industrial: Metals soft; petrochemicals/industrial chemicals and plastics favorable on expansions and business development
  - Premium: International intermodal strong; domestic intermodal growth from highway conversions; auto flat in Q4 but expected to improve in 2025
  - Renewable diesel network: 15 UP-accessible plants now online (two new in Q4; more expected in 2025)
  - Over 200 track-construction customer projects in progress (potential revenue ~$1.5B)
- Cost/productivity
  - >75 initiatives: yard automation, terminal dwell reduction, reduced local/yard starts, engineering automation (inspections, maintenance), purchase services optimization, van automation
  - Fuel consumption rate improved 1% despite less fuel-efficient mix
- Labor/scheduling
  - Second regional brakeman agreement executed; one region remaining; designed to enable more efficient car handling
  - Predictable work schedules: 20 of 28 engineer hubs converted; working with SMART-TD on conductors; aim for cost/start neutrality

4) Q&A Highlights
- Guidance/tone
  - Confident on delivering EPS growth within long-term CAGR range; pricing accretive to margins starting Q4 and continuing through 2025; not parsing quarterly cadence
  - Typical Q1 seasonality: lower volumes, payroll tax reset, weather costs
- Productivity runway
  - Continued opportunity across operations and G&A; sustained “perpetually dissatisfied” culture regarding productivity
- Regulatory
  - FRA waiver backlog: potential to unlock efficiency and safety gains
  - STB: New chair Patrick Fuchs; management seeks faster decisions; views goals as aligned (strong rail service supports economy)
- Tariffs/cross-border
  - Prepared for potential tariff impacts; origin/destination routing can shift (Asia/Mexico/Canada); focus on keeping freight on UP via alternative routings
- Intermodal dynamics
  - Early 2025 international intermodal strength (some pull-ahead); 2H25 faces tough comps
  - Domestic intermodal expected to grow; auto to improve through the year
  - Intermodal RPU headwinds: mix (international lowest RPU) and lower fuel; productivity offsets pursued
- Capacity for upside
  - Operating with ~20–25% rail capacity buffer; capable of handling a 10% volume increase; quick onboarding if needed
- OR ambition
  - Target industry-leading OR; leveraging NetControl and nimble plan changes; not commenting on peers

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary
  - Pricing discipline and accretive price/mix posture reiterated; service improvement underpinning commercial wins
  - Domestic intermodal and petrochemical growth engines; renewable diesel tailwinds; auto recovery later in 2025
  - Coal a headwind but moderated; international intermodal comps a 2H25 volume challenge (mix headwind should ease)
  - Capital allocation more shareholder-friendly: $4–$4.5B buybacks; 45% payout; capex flat and targeted to growth/safety/productivity
- Surprises vs expectations
  - Q4 price accretive earlier than expected
  - Adjusted OR 58.0% a standout
  - Strong FCF and higher planned buybacks

6) Takeaways
- Execution: Q4 delivered record operating income and a 58.0% adjusted OR, with price accretive and productivity offsetting adverse mix and lower fuel surcharges.
- 2025 setup: Expect EPS growth within high single/low double-digit CAGR path; pricing accretive, capex flat, robust buybacks; mixed macro with identified headwinds (coal decline, 2H international intermodal comps).
- Growth levers: Domestic intermodal conversions, petrochemical and plastics expansions, renewable diesel feedstocks, and auto recovery; 200+ customer projects with ~$1.5B potential revenue.
- Resilience: Buffer resources and capacity (20–25%) to protect service and capture upside; continued safety and productivity gains; regulatory waivers could further unlock efficiency.
- Balanced risks: Tariff/regulatory uncertainty, metals softness, coal pressure, and back-half intermodal comp risk; management emphasizes preparedness and routing flexibility.

7) Other Notable Information
- Labor agreements: Second regional brakeman buyout ($40M in Q4) with one region remaining; predictable schedules implemented in 20 of 28 engineer hubs; aim for cost/start neutrality with unions.
- Safety: 2024 improvement in derailments and personal injury rates; casualty expense declined in Q4 (after elevated Q4 2023).
- Fuel: Average price $2.41/gal in Q4 (-24% YoY); fuel consumption rate improved 1%.
- Network investments: Capacity projects on Sunset Route (Southwest), Pacific Northwest sidings; terminal enhancements around Houston/Gulf Coast; intermodal capacity in Kansas City, Inland Empire, and Lathrop.
- Balance sheet: Adjusted debt/EBITDA 2.7x; A credit ratings maintained.
- Misc. revenue/expense items: Lower other revenue tied to 2Q intermodal equipment sale and ongoing transfer of metro operations (with expense offsets); lower bad debt expense in Q4.
- Weather: Winter storms impacted Southeast; recovery swift; atypical snow removal costs in New Orleans noted.
