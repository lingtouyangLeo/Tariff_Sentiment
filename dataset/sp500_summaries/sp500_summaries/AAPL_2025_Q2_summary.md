4) Q&A Highlights
- Tariffs and supply chain:
  - June tariff cost impact ~ $900M; beyond June uncertain due to Section 232 process and potential policy changes.
  - No clear evidence of March quarter demand pull-forward; channel unit inventories ended Q2 similar to start; manufacturing purchase obligations reflect build-ahead.
  - Pricing: no changes announced; focus on supply chain optimization.
  - Resiliency: multi-origin strategy expanding; risk remains inherent in complex supply chain.
- Regional/China:
  - Greater China revenue -2% YoY; roughly flat ex-FX; sequential improvement vs -11% in December quarter.
  - Government/retail subsidies aided results (impact hard to quantify); iPhone and iPad top models in urban China; strong share of new-to-product buyers for Mac/iPad/Watch.
- Margins/Costs:
  - Product GM down q/q due to mix, seasonal leverage, FX; management highlighted track record of cost reductions over product life cycles; services/product mix a key driver.
  - Sourcing more from U.S./India embedded in current margins; Apple won’t forecast beyond current quarter.
- Services and DMA/legal:
  - No category-level outlook for Services due to uncertainties.
  - DMA/alt app stores in Europe are already embedded in results; not forecasting beyond current quarter.
  - Legal matters: Apple will appeal Epic injunction; Google DOJ case ongoing; risks acknowledged, outcomes unclear.
- AI/Devices:
  - Apple Intelligence correlated with stronger iPhone 16 family performance in markets where available; additional language rollouts began in Q3.
  - Current devices run on-device LLM; hybrid approach with Private Cloud Compute; roadmap strong.
  - Data center: hybrid model (Apple + third parties); continued investment planned; not gating AI investments.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Company guides to low- to mid-single-digit YoY revenue growth in June despite tariff uncertainty and FX headwind; Services momentum intact but no category guidance.
  - China stabilizing/improving sequentially; subsidies supportive; iPhone 16 family strength noted.
- Costs/Cap allocation:
  - Tariff headwind quantified for June and less than many feared; unique June supports (build-ahead) won’t necessarily repeat.
  - Ongoing $100B buyback and dividend increase signal confidence; net cash target maintained.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Stronger-than-feared top line and EPS; Services all-time record; explicit disclosure that majority of U.S. iPhones to originate from India in June; modest tariff cost estimate for June.

6) Takeaways
- Solid quarter: Revenue +5% and EPS +8% YoY with Services at an all-time high; iPad and Mac both grew, offsetting softer Wearables comp.
- Tariff risk managed near term: June quarter tariff cost estimated at ~$900M with some temporary mitigants; outlook beyond June remains uncertain pending policy outcomes.
- Supply chain diversification is real: Majority of U.S. iPhones from India in June; Vietnam origin for most U.S.-bound iPad/Mac/Watch/AirPods; China remains key for ex-U.S. markets.
- AI is lifting iPhone: Markets with Apple Intelligence seeing better iPhone 16 performance; more personal Siri features delayed but progress continues; hybrid on-device/cloud architecture differentiates on privacy.
- Capital return underscores confidence: New $100B buyback, higher dividend, and $500B U.S. investment plan signal long-term commitment, though FX and trade policy remain notable uncertainties.
