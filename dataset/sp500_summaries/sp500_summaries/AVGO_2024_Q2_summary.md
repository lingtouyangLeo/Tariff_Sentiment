---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)
- Period: Fiscal Q2 2024
- Industry/Macro Context:
  - AI infrastructure spend by hyperscalers is the core growth driver; Broadcom AI revenue surged as data center clusters scale.
  - Non-AI semis (enterprise/telco) remain cyclical but appear to have bottomed in Q2.
  - VMware integration progressing rapidly: SKU simplification, move to subscriptions, channel restructuring, and significant cost takeout.

    - Broadband: $730M (-39% YoY); weakness persists; bottom 2H’24, recovery in 2025; FY24 down high-30s (worse than prior)
    - Industrial resale: $234M (-10% YoY); FY24 down double-digit (worse than prior)
  - Infrastructure Software revenue: $5.3B (+170% YoY), including VMware at $2.7B (up from $2.1B in Q1)
    - Software GM: 88%; Op margin 60% (64% ex transition costs)
- AI Revenue:
  - Q2 AI revenue: $3.1B (+280% YoY)
  - FY24 AI outlook raised to “over $11B”
- Guidance:
  - FY24 revenue raised to $51B
  - FY24 adjusted EBITDA margin to 61%
- Capital/Shareholder Updates:
  - Dividend paid: $2.4B ($5.25/sh pre-split)
  - 10-for-1 forward stock split effective July 15, 2024; Q3 post-split share count ~4.92B

3) Management Commentary
- VMware Integration/Strategy:
  - Simplified from 8,000+ SKUs to four core offerings; shifted to subscription; ~3,000 of top 10,000 customers signed multi-year subscriptions
  - VMware ABV grew from $1.2B (Q1) to $1.9B (Q2); total software ABV from $1.9B to $2.8B
  - Opex run-rate at VMware reduced to $1.6B in Q2 from $2.3B pre-deal; targeting $1.3B exiting Q4 and ~$1.2B post-integration
  - VMware revenue moving toward ~$4B/quarter; margins expected to converge with “classic Broadcom” software by FY25
  - Strong push for VMware Cloud Foundation (full stack for private cloud) at compelling pricing; multiple consumption routes (direct, VARs, MSP “as-a-service”)
- AI & Semiconductors:
  - Leadership in AI networking (Ethernet) and custom AI accelerators for select hyperscalers
  - Seven of the largest eight AI clusters use Broadcom Ethernet; management expects all mega-scale GPU deployments to be on Ethernet next year
  - Shipping doubled YoY for switches (Tomahawk 5, Jericho 3), PCIe switches, NICs; leading transition to 800G optics; co-developing next-gen (1.6T) with partners
  - Awarded next-gen custom AI accelerators at hyperscalers
  - Networking growth outlook lifted to ~40% YoY in FY24 (from >35%)

4) Q&A Highlights
- Competitive Landscape (NVIDIA):
  - Broadcom does not compete in merchant GPUs; focuses on custom accelerators for select hyperscalers and on Ethernet networking that complements GPUs
  - On networking, Broadcom leverages 25+ years in Ethernet; expects continued leadership despite new offerings (e.g., SpectrumX)
- AI Mix/Trajectory:
  - AI revenue mix evolving from ~80/20 (accelerators/networking) to ~2/3 vs 1/3 now; potentially ~60/40 by year-end
  - “Over $11B” AI guide seen as conservative; quarterly shipments can be lumpy
- Product Cadence:
  - Tomahawk 6 (100T switch) targeted for late 2025; ongoing strong adoption of Tomahawk/Jericho with AI buildouts
- Financial Model for AI Networking:
  - Rough rule: networking (including optics) ~25–30% of GPU value over time; deployment timing creates mix volatility
- Custom AI ASIC Profitability:
  - Gross margin diluted by pass-through HBM content, but operating margins are attractive due to scale and lower opex as % of revenue
- Non-AI Demand:
  - Non-AI networking behaves similarly to server/storage: bottomed in Q2, modest 2H recovery
- Software Ex-VMware:
  - Brocade performing well but remains cyclical; not assumed as a new structurally higher run-rate
- VMware Channel/Routes to Market:
  - Eliminated channel conflict; clear paths: direct for top ~10k customers, expanded VAR/distributor network for long tail, plus MSP hosted option; simplified SKUs/pricing

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on AI demand durability (networking and custom accelerators), prudent/conservative in framing AI guide; constructive on non-AI semi recovery in 2H
- Demand Trends:
  - AI infrastructure accelerating; hyperscalers advancing to 800G/1.6T; next-gen accelerators awarded
  - Enterprise/telco spending remains subdued in broadband; 2025 recovery expected
- Cost/Capital Allocation:
  - Aggressive VMware cost reductions; continued quarterly debt paydown; sustained dividend; stock split broadens access
- Surprises vs Expectations:
  - Upward revision to FY24 revenue and EBITDA margin; stronger AI outlook; VMware ABV momentum; networking growth outlook raised

6) Takeaways
- AI engine driving results: Q2 AI revenue $3.1B (+280% YoY); FY24 AI now “over $11B,” with increasing networking mix and new custom accelerator wins.
- VMware integration ahead of plan: streamlined portfolio, strong subscription transition (ABV up), lower opex run-rate, path to ~$4B/qtr and margin convergence by FY25.
- Guidance raised: FY24 revenue to $51B; adj. EBITDA margin to 61%; networking growth now ~40% YoY; non-AI semis bottomed with modest 2H recovery.
- Profitability resilient: Company-level GM 76.2%, adj. EBITDA 60%; custom ASICs dilute GM via HBM but enhance operating margins; robust FCF despite higher interest/taxes.
- Risks/uncertainties: Broadband weakness through 2024; lumpiness in AI shipments; competitive pressures in AI networking; execution on VMware subscription migration and channel model.
