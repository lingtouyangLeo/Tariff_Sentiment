  - Mix: >90% to regulated utilities; Texas ≈$36B; California ≈$22B+; Sempra Infrastructure ≈$4B (Sempra’s proportionate share; FID-only)

3. Management Commentary
- Strategy and capital allocation:
  - Concentrate on regulated T&D and long-term contracted infrastructure; reduce commodity/environmental/credit risk
  - Build scale in favorable jurisdictions; target roughly half of company earnings from Texas by decade-end
  - Capital plan targets ~10% rate base CAGR; long-term EPS growth now 7–9%
- Sempra Texas (Oncor):
  - 2024 performance: ~$4.7B capex (record), ~15% rate base growth, ~4% volume growth, +77k premises, 4,300 miles of T&D built/upgraded; EEI Emergency Response Award
  - Early comprehensive base rate review planned for 2025 (vs. 2027) to align revenue requirements with higher O&M, insurance, interest, and growth; near‑term 2025 headwind but strengthens 2026+ earnings power
  - Demand signals: transmission points of interconnection up 27% YoY; 137 GW of C&I interconnection interest (+~250% YoY); ~$2B in posted customer collateral; “high‑confidence” C&I load raised to 29 GW through 2031; potential +36 GW to peak by 2031 vs current ~31 GW system peak
  - Capex detail: $36B base plan (60%+ transmission; ~27% distribution via DCRF; ~$3B SRP; ~$2B Permian Basin brownfield local projects; additional Delaware Basin and West Texas 345 kV); $12B incremental opportunities likely within 2025–2029 (SRP updates, Permian import path, additional POIs, ERCOT 765 kV STEP, etc.); pipeline of $55–$75B potential 2030–2034
- Sempra California:
  - 2024 outcomes: Final GRC decisions at SDG&E and SoCalGas; SDG&E awarded Cal/OSHA VPP; best-in-West reliability for 19th consecutive year
  - Investments: wildfire mitigation (industry-leading program maturity), energy storage, AMI replacement, FERC transmission build, compressor modernization, gas safety/integrity
  - Regulatory: CPUC CCM reduced authorized ROE by 42 bps for 2025; FERC removed 50 bps CAISO adder (appeal filed). Aliso Canyon authorized to operate at 68.6 Bcf (~80% capacity)
  - Wildfire risk: AB 1054 $21B fund; SDG&E contributions ~2% (initial ~$320M plus ~$13M/yr); illustrative liability cap ~$1.4B (20% of rolling 3‑yr avg rate base); no significant SDG&E utility-caused wildfire in >17 years
- Sempra Infrastructure:
  - LNG dual-basin strategy advancing: ECA LNG Phase 1 ~90% complete, COD spring 2026; Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 on time/on budget (Trains 1 & 2 COD 2027/2028)
  - Port Arthur LNG Phase 2: HOA with Aramco (5 MTPA offtake, 25% equity); fixed-price EPC with Bechtel; DOE non‑FTA permit expected; targeting FID in 2025
  - Cameron LNG: 98% reliability in 2024; 193 cargoes in 2024; 895 cargoes since 2019
  - SI capex: ~$4B through 2029 (Sempra’s proportionate share; FID projects only); average contract life ~18 years

4. Q&A Highlights
- 2025 guidance reset drivers:
  - California: Final GRC below plan assumptions; CPUC ROE -42 bps (CCM); FERC removed 50 bps CAISO adder
  - Texas: Oncor early rate case pauses/impacts trackers and introduces interim lag in 2025; strengthens 2026+
  - Sempra Infrastructure: ECA LNG Phase 1 COD moved to spring 2026; lower natural gas price assumptions
  - Parent: higher interest expense and greater use of hybrids to fund larger plan
- Rate base vs EPS: Despite +1% rate base CAGR uplift, near-term EPS reduced due to regulatory/timing/financing headwinds; management emphasizes higher long-term earnings power and expects 9%+ EPS CAGR over 2025–2029
- Oncor earned ROE: Currently influenced by lag and 2021 test year; expected to be ~8–9% across plan, trending closer to 9% later with SRP recovery, equity layer adjustments, and more periodic base rate cases
- Financing/credit:
  - Funding via OCF, debt, hybrids (~$3B issued in 2024), equity (ATM in place; ~$270M sold in Q4; $1.3B forward settled late 2024), and capital recycling at SI (evaluating Mexican assets; potential >$1B)
  - Net equity need estimated ~$2–$3B (assuming ≥$1B SI asset sale), front‑loaded; potential buybacks later in plan
  - 2024 FFO/debt below agency thresholds; plan to meet targets in 2025 (S&P ~15%) using equity/hybrids and cash generation
- Legislative/regulatory:
  - Texas session: monitoring large-load cost allocation (e.g., SB6), reflection of actual capital structures in rates (HB 2668), and potential liability limits; constructive tone expected
  - California wildfire regime: AB 1054 viewed as effective; active discussions include extending CWR bonds (perpetual fund), broader participation, or segregated funds; Sempra supportive of strengthening the framework; timing uncertain

5. Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Apologetic for 2025 reset; confident and bullish on medium/long-term growth, particularly Texas and LNG; emphasis on execution, transparency, and improving near-term results
- Surprises vs. expectations: 2025 EPS cut; early Oncor rate case; FERC CAISO adder removal; dividend increase maintained; introduction of strong 2026 EPS guidance; long-term EPS CAGR increased
- Demand trends: Exceptional ERCOT large C&I/data center interest (+137 GW queue; +29 GW high-confidence through 2031); steady residential premise growth (~2%); LNG demand expected robust through 2040–2050
- Cost/returns outlook: Higher O&M/insurance/interest addressed via early rate case, trackers (97% of Oncor capex recoverable via trackers), and capital structure/ROE initiatives; SI exposure mitigated by long-term contracts

6. Takeaways
- 2025 EPS reset to $4.30–$4.70 reflects regulatory and timing headwinds (CA GRC/ROE, FERC adder removal, Oncor early rate case, ECA LNG COD shift), but 2026 guidance rebounds to $4.80–$5.30; management now targets 9%+ EPS CAGR for 2025–2029.
- Record $56B five‑year capex with ~10% rate base CAGR; Texas is the engine (Oncor $36B base + ~$12B likely incremental within plan) with even larger opportunities into the 2030s; aim for ~50% of company earnings from Texas by decade‑end.
- California remains a significant platform: sustained investment in wildfire mitigation, reliability, storage, AMI; near‑term returns pressured by CCM ROE reduction and FERC adder removal; appeal in process; AB 1054 continues to support financial stability.
- Sempra Infrastructure execution remains solid: ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1 progressing on time/budget; Port Arthur Phase 2 is targeting 2025 FID with strong commercial interest and de‑risking via fixed‑price EPC and shared facilities.
- Financing front‑loaded and diversified (OCF, debt, hybrids, equity, SI capital recycling) with intent to protect credit metrics and enable potential buybacks later; dividend increased to $2.58.
