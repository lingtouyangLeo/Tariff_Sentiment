- Period: Fiscal Q1 2024
- Macro/industry backdrop:
  - Fed held rates and signaled three cuts in 2024; inflation easing but above 2% target.
  - Capital markets activity and hiring remain lagging; client budgets tight amid lower deal-making, layoffs, and geopolitical uncertainty.
  - Sales cycles lengthening across firm types; vendor consolidation conversations increasing.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: $542M GAAP (+7% YoY); $541M organic (+7% YoY).
- EPS: GAAP $3.84 (+9.1% YoY); Adjusted $4.12 (+3.3% YoY).
- Margins: GAAP operating margin 35% (+~80 bps YoY); Adjusted operating margin 37.6% (-70 bps YoY).
- ASV: Organic ASV + professional services +7.1% YoY; ASV retention >95%; client retention 90%; ~8,000 clients, 24 net new logos.
- Cash/returns: FCF $139M (+56% YoY) on stronger collections; EBITDA $219M (+9.3% YoY). Repurchased 136k shares for $60M (avg $441); targeting ~$250M FY24 buybacks; LTM capital returns $379M (dividends + buybacks).

- Regional/firm-type trends:
  - Americas ASV +7.9% (accelerated); EMEA +5.4% (decelerated); APAC +8%.
  - Wealth accelerated (major U.S. win; +17,000 seats). Banking weaker (churn, reduced seasonal hiring). Buy side softer front-office demand; asset owners/hedge funds facing elongated cycles. Data solutions/partners were bright spots.

Guidance (revised FY24)
- Organic ASV + PS: +$110–$150M (6% growth at midpoint; down from 7% prior).
- Revenue: $2.20–$2.21B (~6% growth midpoint; ~75 bps below prior guide).
- Operating margin: GAAP 32.5%–33.0% (down); Adjusted 36.3%–36.7% (unchanged; +30 bps YoY expansion at midpoint).
- Effective tax rate: 16.5%–17.5% (down 50 bps).
- Adjusted EPS: $15.60–$16.00 (+7.8% growth midpoint; ~$0.10 below prior).
- Q2 actions: $10–$15M charge tied to a cost-reduction program; targeting ~$30M cost saves to protect adjusted margin.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/product:
  - Major wealth displacement at a large U.S. firm (longer-than-average >5-year contract) and a significant trading win at a top U.S. asset manager validate open-platform and portfolio lifecycle strategy.
  - AI: Launched FactSet Mercury (LLM-based conversational interface) in beta via FactSet Explorer; focus on auditability, suggestions, and NL-driven charting into Microsoft Office. Also released AI-enhanced transcript highlights and news summaries.
  - Ongoing multi-year investments: Deep sector and real-time, wealth workstation, portfolio lifecycle; expanding into private credit analytics (Cobalt) and data solutions.
- Pricing/demand:
  - Annual price increases proceeding broadly as usual, but price realization is ~1 point lower vs. Q4; clients are using renewals to rationalize seat lists (erosion).
  - Wealth seeing strong TCO-led demand; mid-tier firms modernizing; expanding beyond advisor dashboards into data (APIs & widgets) and CRM.
- Cost discipline:
  - Balancing margin expansion with growth investments; tech spend (including cloud) will be monitored as AI scales. People ~65% of expense base; real estate and third-party data costs flat-to-down for FY.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Outlook revision drivers (approximate impacts):
  - ~40 bps from pricing pressure/lower price realization, ~30 bps higher erosion, ~25 bps delayed decisions/pushouts; minimal pipeline fallout.
  - Firm-type pressure: ~50% of reduction from dealmakers (banking), ~25% from buy side; wealth remains strong but with slower advisor hiring and some small-firm losses.
- Q2 softness:
  - Prior-year Q2 had outsized pricing; this year’s annual increase is lower.
  - UBS/Credit Suisse integration downsizing expected to be a material headwind in Q2.
- Cost actions:
  - Target ~$30M savings: T&E ($1–$2M), professional services ($3–$4M), bonus pool moderation (~$5M), plus personnel-related cuts (tied to Q2 charge). Q1 opex $338M; Q2 ~ $350M then flatten.
- AI roadmap and monetization:
  - Three pillars: mile-wide discoverability (Mercury), mile-deep workflow automation (e.g., pitchbooks, performance commentary), and mile-high innovation acceleration (client “building blocks”).
  - Conversational experience likely included with workstations; workflow automation to be monetized separately. No explicit FY24 ASV uplift assumed; expect retention benefits and new-logo support.
  - Internal AI efficiency (engineering Copilot, content collection, help desk copilots) to show more impact in FY25; some H2 FY24 potential.
- Vendor consolidation:
  - Top-down push at large clients to consolidate and lower TCO; FactSet positioning improving due to open platform and AI investments.
- M&A:
  - Focus areas: wealth tech, private markets, portfolio lifecycle. Market “thawing”; leverage reset post-CUSIP integration. Long-term, data asset owners likely to be AI winners.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Near-term: sales cycles elongated; Q2 weaker; clients’ CY24 budgets largely flat but asked to do more (efficiency, reporting, scale).
  - Back-half optimism tied to improving rate backdrop and potential recovery in capital markets; hiring remains a lagging indicator.
- Costs/margins:
  - Committed to adjusted margin range despite lower revenue via targeted cost program; tech/cloud spend could rise with AI success.
- Capital allocation:
  - Continue disciplined buybacks (~$250M FY24) and dividend; strong cash collections underpin FCF.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Negative: Lower top-line and ASV guidance; Q2 weaker (including UBS/CS headwind).
  - Positive: Maintained adjusted margin guidance; marquee wealth and trading wins; robust FCF improvement.

6) Takeaways
- Near-term softness, long-term confidence: Guidance trimmed on slower budget releases, pricing realization, and erosion, yet management remains confident in strategy and competitive position.
- Protecting margins while investing: Adjusted margin target maintained via ~$30M cost actions; AI, deep sector, real-time, and wealth/workflow automation remain priority investments.
- AI is central to product and go-to-market: Mercury beta launched; differentiated on auditability and workflow depth; monetization to favor embedded UX plus premium automation.
- Wealth momentum and large-deal capacity: Big U.S. wealth displacement (+17k seats) and major buy-side trading win underscore rising enterprise deal size; expect lumpier ASV but stronger TCO/value narrative.
- Watch Q2, look to H2: Q2 pressured by UBS/CS and lighter pricing compare; potential improvement later in FY if capital markets/hiring recover.

7) Other Notable Information
- Credit Suisse/UBS integration expected to be a material Q2 headwind; size not quantified.
- FactSet Focus user conference in Miami (April/May) with heavy AI emphasis.
- Private credit is a growing focus area for analytics and data solutions (Cobalt; extensions of fixed income capabilities).
- Pricing cadence: Americas increases effective Jan 1; International in April; rate cards unchanged.
