1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP)
- Period: Q1 of fiscal year 2024
- Macro/industry context:
  - Demand environment unchanged vs. 2H FY23: muted enterprise spending, elongated sales cycles
  - Large enterprise verticals most cautious: service providers, high tech, and to a lesser extent financial services; midsize enterprise and public sector performed better
  - Customers running infrastructure at higher utilization (“hotter”) than best practice; management expects eventual normalization without assuming macro improvement in guidance
  - AI is a pervasive theme; NetApp positions hybrid data management and unstructured data expertise as core advantages; strong focus on cyber resilience

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q1 results (non-GAAP unless noted):
  - Revenue: $1.4B, down 10% YoY (above guidance midpoint)
    - Hybrid Cloud (systems/support): $1.3B, down 12% YoY
    - Product revenue: $590M, down 25% YoY (tough compare due to elevated backlog shipments in 1H FY23)
    - Support revenue: $611M, up 2% YoY
    - Public Cloud revenue: $154M, up 17% YoY; Public Cloud ARR: $619M, up 6% YoY; DBNRR: 107%
  - Gross margin: 71%, +400 bps YoY (company record)
    - Product GM: 55% (guided to hold FY24)
    - Support GM: 92%
    - Public Cloud GM: 67% (up 1 pt QoQ)
  - Operating margin: 22% (above guidance)
  - EPS: $1.15 (above high end of guidance)
- Cash/Balance sheet:
  - Operating cash flow: $453M (+61% YoY); Free cash flow: $418M (+94% YoY)
  - Returned $506M to shareholders (~120% of FCF) via dividends and buybacks; intent to return 100% of FY24 FCF
  - Net cash: ~+$600M; Cash & short-term investments: ~$3B; Deferred revenue: $4.2B (slightly up YoY)
  - Working capital: DSO 41; inventory turns 13
- Guidance:
  - FY24: Revenue down low- to mid-single digits YoY; consolidated GM ~70%; operating margin ~25%; EPS $5.65–$5.85
  - Public Cloud growth for FY24 now below initial expectations (subscription softness), offset by Hybrid Cloud strength; overall FY guide reiterated
  - Q2 FY24: Revenue $1.455–$1.605B (midpoint -8% YoY); consolidated GM ~70%; operating margin ~24%; EPS $1.35–$1.50; potential ~200 bps FX tailwind if rates hold

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and execution:
  - Tight operational control; reinvigorate core storage; sharpen public cloud focus
  - GTM changes implemented: enterprise sellers focused on flash; dedicated cloud specialist org aligned to hyperscalers; added customer success; global sales kickoff energized pipeline
  - Expect top-line growth in 2H FY24 driven by execution and new products
- Product/portfolio:
  - All-Flash: AFF C‑Series is fastest-ramping all-flash launch in company history; AFF A150 ramping well
  - New SAN portfolio: ASA A‑Series all-flash arrays with data availability/efficiency guarantees and VM/app-level protection; targeting $18B SAN market
  - Storage Lifecycle Program gaining traction; ransomware recovery guarantee introduced
  - NetApp cited as the only enterprise storage vendor on NSA’s classified program components list
- AI positioning:
  - ONTAP AI with NVIDIA since 2018; hundreds of AI customers across pharma, financials, retail
  - Strength in unstructured data, hybrid data pipelines (file/object across on-prem and cloud)
  - Active in both on-prem fine-tuning and hyperscaler GenAI offerings; AI/ML features embedded for anomaly/ransomware detection
- Public Cloud focus:
  - Priority on first‑party services branded/sold by cloud partners (Azure, AWS FSx for ONTAP, Google)—seeing customer expansion and AR growth
  - Weakness concentrated in subscription services (BYOL and CloudOps); strategic review underway to refine portfolio, pricing, and value propositions; more details next quarter
  - Notable win: AWS FSxN selected for a global sportswear company’s large, mission-critical SAP HANA deployment (multi-year consumption driver)
- Supply chain/NAND:
  - Locked in record-low NAND pricing through strategic purchase commitments; confident product GM holds ~55% in FY24 despite potential price competition
  - Increasing mix of QLC NAND; some price agreements extend into FY25; evaluating further hedging

4) Q&A Highlights
- Demand trends:
  - Macro unchanged; mid-market and public sector outperforming large enterprise; expect customers can’t run systems “hot” indefinitely, but guidance does not assume macro improvement
- Repatriation and AI:
  - GenAI is not a meaningful driver of cloud repatriation at this stage; customers deploying a mix of on-prem (data control) and cloud (feature velocity, pre-packaged models)
- Margins/competition:
  - Supply chain premiums now fully gone from P&L and cash; historical premiums were ~$30–50M per quarter
  - Price competition normal; guidance assumes modestly more aggressive pricing in spots; still confident in 55% product GM
- Cloud metrics:
  - Cloud mix ~75% consumption / ~25% subscription; consumption growing and at industry-standard DBNRR; subscription is the weak spot (renewal downgrades, deployment delays)
  - Portfolio/pricing/value-prop optimization in progress; update next quarter
- All-flash trajectory/share:
  - Reported –7% YoY AFA impacted by backlog compare; backlog-adjusted, flash grew; capacity flash (C-Series) strong; expect flash to rise as % of mix; management believes NTAP is #2 in share behind Dell
- NAND cycle into FY25:
  - FY24 largely hedged; some carryover into FY25; will reassess hedges over next 90 days
- HDD outlook:
  - NetApp will continue to offer both HDD and flash; skeptical of claims HDDs will cease within five years; will provide customer choice
- Linearity and H2 setup:
  - H1/H2 revenue split ~48%/52% (unchanged); Q2 up ~7% QoQ; even with lower Public Cloud growth, FY guide intact
- Cash flow cadence:
  - FY24 OCF to track close to non-GAAP NI (~$1.2B); Q2 seasonally lower cash due to tax payments (~$88M repatriation plus federal)

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - H2 revenue growth expected, driven by C‑Series capacity flash, new SAN portfolio, and GTM changes; pipeline expanding
  - Continued prioritization of first-party cloud services; imminent expansion of Google partnership
  - Cost tailwinds from NAND locks; disciplined opex (flat YoY in Q1); commitment to return 100% of FY24 FCF
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Positive: Record gross margin, EPS beat, strong FCF, product GM resilience
  - Negative: Public Cloud subscription softness and DBNRR moderation (to 107%); total revenue still down YoY on tough compares

6) Takeaways
- Innovation-led storage refresh is working: C‑Series/A150/ASA A‑Series ramping, supporting H2 revenue inflection and sustained 55% product GM despite competition.
- Public Cloud is mixed: strong first‑party/marketplace consumption offset by subscription underperformance; strategic portfolio/pricing actions underway; focus remains on hyperscaler-aligned services.
- Macro still cautious: large enterprise verticals slow; customers running systems at high utilization; management not banking on macro improvement to meet FY24 guide.
- Financial discipline strong: record company GM, robust cash generation, FY24 GM/OM/EPS reiterated; NAND pricing secured through FY24, some into FY25.
- AI credible but early for revenue inflection: deep AI credentials (ONTAP AI, unstructured data leadership) and notable hyperscaler integrations; meaningful long-term opportunity rather than immediate step-up.

7) Other Notable Information

- Large AWS FSxN SAP HANA win expected to be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS over time
- Ransomware recovery guarantee launched; NetApp uniquely on NSA’s classified program components list
- Working capital improvements: DSO 41; inventory turns 13
