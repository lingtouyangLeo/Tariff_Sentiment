Management Commentary
- Strategy and priorities:
  - Continued cost discipline and restructuring benefits driving margin acceleration
  - Reignited performance culture focused on productivity and operational excellence
  - Prioritizing core platform innovation and integrating acquired products more deeply into the core
  - Deepening investor relationships and transparency
  - AI transformation as a formal priority: “AI + Data + CRM + Trust” as the architecture for the next growth chapter
- Product/innovation highlights:
  - Data Cloud: fastest-growing organic product; deeply integrated into Salesforce metadata architecture; 6T records ingested and 1T activations in Q2; goal to “turn it on” quickly for all customers
  - Einstein and Trust Layer: Generative AI assistant capabilities across Sales, Service, Marketing, and Slack; unique trust layer to preserve data privacy/security/residency/compliance
  - Slack: becoming front-end for Salesforce; “Slack Sales Elevate” to bring core Sales Cloud inside Slack; 8M workflows launched weekly (+71% YoY)
  - MuleSoft: significant momentum; included in half of top 10 deals and nearly half of >$1M deals
  - Industry clouds: 8 industry clouds grew ARR >50% for the third consecutive quarter
  - Small business: Salesforce Starter (integrated sales, service, marketing) for faster time-to-value
- Go-to-market:
  - Multi-cloud expansion remains a central growth engine; >450 customers spend >$10M annually and average 7 clouds
  - International strength (Canada, France, India); U.S. remains constrained
  - Sectors: resilience in manufacturing, automotive, energy; more measured in high tech, retail/consumer goods
- Capital allocation: ongoing buybacks with commitment to offset SBC; continued investment in AI/data/core products; openness to inorganic opportunities but prioritizing investor trust and profitability commitments

Q&A Highlights
- Growth vs. margins: Management remains committed to profitable growth; AI/data are investment priorities. FY24 30% non-GAAP margin is raised and characterized by CFO as a “floor, not a ceiling” over time, though near-term H2 margins will be non-linear due to R&D timing.
- AI demand and wallet share: Expect AI to catalyze IT budgets; plan to expand multi-cloud adoption, accelerate internationally, and deepen industry verticals. Dreamforce expected as a demand catalyst.
- Pricing actions: Summer price uplift is included in guidance but not material for FY24; benefits phase in over 1–3 years via renewals.
- Headcount: Down ~11% YoY; hiring in AI, core engineering, and growth geographies/products; no plans for further major restructuring.
- CRPO re-acceleration: Management aims to re-accelerate growth longer term with AI/Data Cloud, but balances with profitability; CRPO still impacted by prior five quarters’ measured sales performance.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Macro remains measured, but management expects AI to spark a multi-year buying cycle; near-term sales cycles remain elongated; PS weakness persists.
- Cost outlook: Strong cost discipline continues; H2 FY24 investment ramp in AI R&D creates non-linear margins.
- Capital allocation: Continued buybacks to offset SBC; tax cash outflows to increase this year and more next year as NOLs/credits are drawn down.
- Surprises vs. expectations: Margin performance notably ahead; CRPO ahead of plan driven by MuleSoft; pricing uplift impact minimal near-term.

Takeaways
- Salesforce accelerated its profitability transformation: Q2 non-GAAP operating margin at 31.6% and FY24 margin raised to 30%, three quarters ahead of plan.
- Growth steady amid macro headwinds: 11% revenue growth and 12% CRPO in Q2; U.S. more constrained; PS softness and elongated cycles persist.
- AI/Data Cloud central to next leg: Strong Data Cloud and Einstein momentum; MuleSoft a standout contributor; Slack evolving into the primary interface.
- Guidance prudent on AI/pricing near term: AI benefits and price increases largely flow through over multi-year renewals; H2 margins non-linear on R&D timing.
- Capital returns continue: $1.9B buybacks in Q2; >$8B since inception; intent to fully offset SBC dilution.
