*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AppLovin (APP)
- Period: Q2 FY2024 (quarter ended June 30, 2024)
- Industry/Macro context:
  - Mobile gaming market growing low single digits (3–4% range), but ad-supported gaming growing faster than in-app purchase (IAP).
  - Management emphasizes that slower market growth does not constrain the software platform, which is performance- and ROI-driven and limited primarily by model match rates rather than advertiser budgets.
  - Axon 2 AI models continue to self-learn and improve with scale/data.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q2 Results:
  - Total revenue: $1.08B (+44% YoY)
  - Adjusted EBITDA: $601M (+80% YoY); margin 56%
  - Flow-through: 81% from revenue to adjusted EBITDA
  - Free cash flow: grew 15% QoQ (management cited $446M FCF in Q1; Q2 FCF implied higher), ~74% conversion of adj. EBITDA in Q1; Q2 benefited from stable cash taxes and interest
- Segment detail:
  - Software platform: $711M revenue; $520M adj. EBITDA; 73% margin; +91% YoY; continued Axon-driven gains; strong cost discipline with high flow-through
  - Apps: $369M revenue (+7% YoY); $81M adj. EBITDA (22% margin). Readjusted UA return goals cut costs 11% QoQ; revenue down 3% QoQ. Long-term margin expected to normalize around 15%
- Guidance (Q3 FY2024):
  - Revenue: $1.115–$1.135B
  - Adjusted EBITDA: $630–$650M
  - Target adj. EBITDA margin: ~57%

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Sustained model improvement from self-learning as data scale increases
  - Team-led enhancements to models can create step-function performance gains (beyond steady self-learning)
  - Demand expansion beyond gaming: launched pilot for web advertising (e-commerce “shops” and broader web), driving users from in-app inventory to websites on a performance/attribution basis; early results “materially better” than expected
  - Supply expansion: broaden demand base outside gaming to expand CPV footprint
- Long-term target:
  - Software platform growth goal: 20–30% per year over the long term
  - Management asserts this target is achievable even without non-gaming; non-gaming is incremental upside
- Capital allocation:
  - Invest in organic growth (engineering/BD for Axon and e-commerce); lean hiring, no large capex expected
  - Share management: withhold-to-cover plus strategic repurchases; Q2 used $356M to withhold 4.2M shares; since 2022, ~$3B for repurchases/withholds (83.6M shares)
  - Strengthen balance sheet, enhance liquidity, reduce net debt
- Competitive positioning:
  - AppLovin seen as the main performance channel in mobile gaming; broad adoption across large publishers, including prior holdouts
  - Differentiation vs. exchanges/DSPs (e.g., Trade Desk) via revenue-predictive models, performance attribution, and end-to-end optimization

4) Q&A Highlights
- Non-gaming/e-commerce:
  - Web/e-commerce pilot live for “a few months”; promising early outcomes; potential to be material in 2025 and beyond; not limited to e-commerce—any transactional website could participate
  - Data/model applicability to e-comm: leverages massive existing data (billion+ DAUs; tens of billions in transactional volume) plus vertical-specific iteration
- Software trajectory and guidance:
  - Q3 guide implies continued acceleration in software driven by ongoing model improvements and step-function enhancements when they occur
  - Management expects steady 3–5% QoQ contribution from model self-learning plus potential step-ups from engineering enhancements; long-term 20–30% annual software growth does not assume non-gaming
- Market health:
  - Overall mobile gaming IAP growth remains low single digits; ad-supported segment growing faster
- Buybacks:
  - Continue withhold-to-cover each quarter, plus opportunistic repurchases; no change to disciplined approach
- Apps segment/M&A:
  - Apps UA goals tightened to improve profitability; open to divestitures/M&A when market conditions improve
- Publishers/partners:
  - Greater adoption among large publishers; very few (if any) material holdouts; strong customer momentum
- Model mechanics:
  - High accuracy against advertiser ROAS/breakeven objectives (e.g., 30-day breakeven); growth constrained more by model match rate than budgets; as models improve, spend scales naturally at target returns

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and execution-focused; emphasis on strong momentum, high cash conversion, and continued margin expansion
- Forward-looking:
  - Expect continued QoQ gains from self-learning plus potential step-function lifts; non-gaming is shifting from technology risk to go-to-market scaling
  - Q3 guide points to higher margins (~57%) with continued revenue growth
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Strength of software platform (+91% YoY, sustained 73% margin) and strong flow-through; early non-gaming pilot outperforming internal expectations
- Risks/uncertainties:
  - Dependence on continued model improvement and data advantages; non-gaming still in pilot (execution/scale timing risk); mobile gaming market remains low-growth; apps margins expected to trend toward 15% LT

6) Takeaways
- Software engine is the growth and margin driver: +91% YoY revenue with 73% margin; Axon 2’s self-learning and engineering enhancements underpin 3–5% QoQ baseline growth with potential step-ups.
- Q3 outlook constructive: Revenue $1.115–$1.135B and adj. EBITDA $630–$650M imply reacceleration and margin expansion to ~57%.
- Non-gaming pilot shows promise: Web/e-commerce performance ads from in-app inventory delivering better-than-expected early results; potential 2025 impact; upside not embedded in LT growth target.
- Strong cash generation and disciplined capital returns: High EBITDA and FCF conversion; continued share management and balance sheet strengthening.
- Balanced risks: Mobile gaming market is low-growth; non-gaming scale timing uncertain; ongoing need to sustain model accuracy/match rates. However, large publisher adoption and data scale reinforce competitive moat.
