1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company/Period: Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX), fiscal 3Q 2024

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/Cloud:
  - Pivoting in 2025 from building to leveraging the Equifax Cloud for growth, innovation, AI/ML, and margin expansion; decommissioning legacy systems lowers opex and capex.
  - 100% of new models/scores built using Equifax AI/ML in 3Q (vs 89% in 2Q), exceeding 2024 goal.
- Product/Innovation:
  - Vitality Index (new product revenue mix) 13% in 3Q; full-year guidance raised to ~11% (from 10%).
  - USIS to accelerate innovation post-migration (Identity & Fraud Count360 platform, Commercial, mortgage pre-qual, OneScore/alt-data models).
  - “Only Equifax” initiatives: combining The Work Number (TWN) income/employment with credit to differentiate files (e.g., income/employment flags for mortgage shopping and auto), plus alternative datasets (DataX, Teletrack, NCTUE) in scores.
- EWS/TWN Data Flywheel:
  - New Workday partnership to roll out verification services; onboarding late 4Q with substantial records in 2025. Five additional partners signed (collectively >5M future records). 12 strategic partnerships in 2024; 45 since 2021.
  - 3Q adds: +2M active records; 182M active (+12% y/y) across 134M unique individuals; 3.8M companies contributing (40% CAGR since 2020). Total records >700M, supporting trended solutions.
- Government Strength:
  - Government +29% in 3Q; signed SSA redetermination extension (~$500M over 5 years). Focus on state agency penetration across $5B TAM; expect ongoing strong double-digit growth, though 4Q y/y growth below 3Q due to comp.
- Capital Allocation/Framework:
  - Long-term framework reaffirmed: 7–10% organic revenue growth (EWS 13–15%), 50 bps annual EBITDA margin expansion, capex to 6–7% of revenue, leverage toward ~2.5x by YE, and new cash conversion goal ≥95% (FCF/adjusted NI).
  - Plan to begin returning cash in 2025 via dividend growth (generally aligned with earnings growth) and multi-year buybacks, while maintaining 1–2 pts of growth from bolt-on M&A (focus on EWS, differentiated data, Identity & Fraud).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Guidance philosophy: unchanged; transparent and built to meet/beat; 4Q midpoint trim (~$15M) is concentrated in EWS Employer (ERC halted; WOTC state delays; softer onboarding; white-collar hiring slowdown). Mortgage shift had minimal impact on the guide change.
- Workday partnership: sizable but not quantified; records begin onboarding late 4Q and ramp through 2025; ongoing pipeline of strategic and direct employer record additions.
- EWS consumer lending strength: driven by combining credit with verified income/employment to increase approvals with lower losses; records growth lifts hit rates.
- FMS outperformance: driven by new wins and expansion (not macro signal), notably in payments; 4Q FMS expected roughly flat y/y.
- Mortgage dynamics: Expect EWS to continue outperforming TWN inquiries (target ~10%+ spread) via records/pricing; do not expect TWN inquiries to converge with credit pulls due to consumer “shopping” behavior. Only Equifax income flags aim to drive USIS share in shopping.
- $1B+ mortgage upside: based on 2015–2019 “normal” mix (55% purchase/45% refi) at current pricing/records/products; to be refreshed in Feb. Rate declines would spark refi first; purchase constrained by inventory.
- Pricing: Annual increases expected (details on 2025 in Feb).
- Capex/costs: Capex stepping down again in 2025, moving toward 6–7% of revenue; D&A to rise slightly more in 2025; restructuring savings >$70M annual run-rate by early 2025; more cloud savings as international completes migrations.
- International: Continued margin expansion expected with cloud completion in UK (2025) and ANZ (2026), plus LatAm migrations.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident about post-cloud phase, innovation cadence, and pricing; candid about Employer Services headwinds and white-collar hiring softness; mortgage recovery framed as sizable, inevitable tailwind.
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Demand: Non-mortgage growth sustained; watchpoints in white-collar hiring and I&F chargebacks.
  - Costs: Decommissioning drives margin expansion and lower capex; restructuring savings in 2025.
  - Capital returns: Clear path to dividend growth and buybacks starting 2025, while maintaining disciplined bolt-on M&A.
- Surprises vs expectations: USIS materially stronger; mortgage inquiries positive; EWS Employer weaker, causing modest revenue guide trim.

6) Takeaways
- Cloud pivot nearing completion unlocks growth levers: faster NPI/AI innovation, “Only Equifax” cross-asset solutions, reduced capex, and higher margins.
- Mortgage bottoming; significant long-term earnings power: >$1B revenue, ~$700M EBITDA, ~$4 EPS upside as activity normalizes; near-term dynamics still rate/inventory-driven.
- EWS remains structural growth engine: Government and Talent strong; record growth and partnerships (Workday) support sustained outperformance; Employer Services headwinds transient.
- Solid 4Q setup despite slight guide trim: EBITDA margin expansion, first-ever $500M+ quarterly EBITDA, and EPS growth demonstrate operating leverage.
- 2025 inflection for cash returns: higher FCF with capex at 6–7% of revenue; initiating dividend growth and multi-year buybacks while preserving M&A optionality.

7) Other Notable Information
- Restructuring: $42M in 3Q for workforce streamlining and post-migration cost actions; >$70M annual savings by early 2025.
- AI adoption: 100% of new models/scores built with Equifax AI/ML in 3Q (vs 89% in 2Q), ahead of targets.
- Contract wins: SSA redetermination extension (~$500M/5 years); continued state-level government penetration; Workday strategic partnership plus five other partners (>5M future records).
- Segment-level 4Q margin guidance:
  - EWS adj. EBITDA margin ~52% (slightly above 3Q).
  - USIS adj. EBITDA margin >38% (strong sequential lift as legacy systems decommission).
  - International adj. EBITDA margin >32% (strong sequential improvement).
