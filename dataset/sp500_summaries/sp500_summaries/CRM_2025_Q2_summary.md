Management Commentary
- AgentForce:
  - GA in October; autonomous agents for sales, service, marketing, commerce, and industry roles.
  - Monetization: consumption-based, management framed ~$2 per conversation; high-margin opportunity. Aspirational target to reach “a billion agents” by end of FY26 (not formal guidance).
  - Early outcomes: 
    - Large U.S. healthcare org resolving >90% of patient inquiries via AgentForce; scheduling and care navigation included.
    - Wiley: double-digit CSAT and deflection improvement; ~50% increase in case resolution during peak season.
    - OpenTable: scales support for 60k restaurants/160M diners (account, reservations, loyalty questions).
  - Workday named as first AgentForce partner.
- Data Cloud:
  - Characterized as fastest-growing organic product in company history; paid customers +130% YoY; $1M+ customers nearly doubled.
  - Q2 processed 2.3 quadrillion records; platform consumption +110% YoY.
  - Foundation for AI quality/accuracy; federates via zero-copy alliances.
- Platform and differentiation:
  - Unified architecture: apps, data, and agents on one metadata-driven platform; accelerated integration of prior acquisitions to improve AI accuracy and reduce hallucinations (new augmented RAG techniques).
  - Anti-DIY AI stance: management warning customers against bespoke model-building; positioning Salesforce as trusted, out-of-the-box enterprise AI at scale.
- Go-to-market:
  - Multi-cloud deals ~80% of new business.
  - 25T quarterly Einstein transactions; >1T workflows; 250 PB managed.
  - “Salesforce CTOs” advisory team for AI roadmaps; channel diversification (3 of top 10 deals via AWS Marketplace).
  - Industry AI toolkit with 100+ ready-to-use actions to build industry-specific agents.

Q&A Highlights
- Growth composition and timing:
  - Levers: core apps + Data Cloud + agents; vertical solutions; international expansion; channel (AWS Marketplace, resellers).
  - AI bookings momentum: 1,500 AI deals signed in Q2; AI bookings more than doubled QoQ. GenAI/agents expected to increasingly contribute as GA launches and deployments scale.
  - Focus on reducing attrition via adoption and feature usage to drive net expansion.
- Pricing/seat implications:
  - Agents to be consumption-priced (e.g., per conversation) rather than seat-based to capture value from deflection and automation; customers evaluate all-in contact center costs when adopting.
- Deployment speed and prerequisites:
  - AgentForce can be activated quickly; Data Cloud not required but materially improves accuracy and value.
- Americas growth:
  - Softness attributed to measured demand and large SMB/transactional mix, not saturation or competition; management expects re-acceleration to double-digit growth with innovation and multi-cloud momentum.
- Macro/rates/election:
  - No explicit call; focus remained on agent-first transformation and ROI anecdotes.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Confidence:
  - Margin and cash flow guidance raised; record non-GAAP margin and shareholder returns; strong CRPO despite FX headwinds.
  - Clear, monetizable AgentForce model and near-term GA timeline; aggressive enablement planned at Dreamforce; stated goal of thousands of AgentForce customers by early next fiscal year.
- Caution:
  - FY revenue guidance maintained despite Q2 beat; persistent measured demand assumed; license revenue decel and services headwind flagged; FX headwinds.
  - Americas growth slower given transactional exposure.
- Capital allocation:
  - Significant buybacks plus dividend; intent to more than fully offset FY25 SBC dilution.

Takeaways
- AgentForce marks a major product/monetization pivot to consumption-based autonomous agents; early pilots show >90% resolution in complex use cases.
- Data Cloud is scaling rapidly and underpins AI accuracy; paid customers +130% YoY and consumption up triple digits.
- Solid quarter with record margin/FCF; CRPO strong; FY margin and cash flow guidance raised, revenue held amid measured demand and 2H license deceleration.
- Multi-cloud and international remain key growth engines; channel diversification (AWS Marketplace) gaining traction.
