3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/initiatives:
  - Intensifying value strategy with greater penetration of quality branded bargains; continuing into fall.
  - Assortment adjustments, especially in ladies’ and newer dd’s markets; expanding vendor base to support brand/value mix.
  - Productivity and cost initiatives:
    - DC automation: automated vehicles, carton-building robots, automated store sorting; new Houston DC contributing.
    - Store ops: piloting self-checkout; new handhelds for inventory/markdowns/tasking; rolling out flexible scheduling.
    - Logistics: contracted domestic freight rate benefits expected in 2H; ocean freight neutral.
- Categories/regions:
  - Strongest: cosmetics and children’s; home in line; shoes slightly below due to tough compares; overall apparel in line with chain but ladies still below chain average.
  - Geography: performance broad-based; California outperformed; Florida in line; Texas slightly below (Hurricane Beryl impact).
- Capital allocation:
  - Continued robust share repurchases; steady store growth focus within U.S.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Comp cadence: strongest mid-quarter; not providing intra-quarter/back-to-school specifics.
- Basket/AUR: AUR up slightly (more brands), UPT down slightly; basket up modestly; traffic up.
- Merchandise margin: -80 bps in Q2; expected additional pressure in 2H as branded penetration increases; offsets from DC productivity, domestic freight, and lower incentives.
- Expense flow-through: beyond sales leverage, company ahead on expense/cost initiatives; some incremental 2H benefits now embedded in guide.
- Shrink: environment remains tough; Q3 inventory count true-up; guidance assumes deterioration vs. LY.
- Consumer behavior: events matter but no major traffic pattern shift; customer clearly seeking value amid persistent inflation in necessities.
- Shoes detail: athletic/active solid; brown more mixed; sandals strong; later boot flow vs. LY.
- International: focus remains on domestic growth opportunity (potential to ~2,900 Ross and ~700 dd’s); no comment on international deals.
- Long-term margin: 10–15 bps OM expansion per +1 pt of comp remains the rule of thumb; ceiling dependent on comps and inflation (wages/fuel).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Cautious on macro and tougher 2H comparisons, but confident in value strategy and execution; raising FY EPS.
- Demand trends: Value-seeking intensifying; branded bargains resonating; inventory supply supportive.
- Cost outlook: Favorable domestic freight and DC productivity; stable wage environment (increases mainly statutory); incentive expense still a tailwind vs. a very strong FY2023.
- Surprise vs. expectations: Q2 beat driven by sales and stronger-than-planned efficiency gains; 2H EPS raised on cost efficiencies despite planned merch margin headwinds; Q4 EPS guide below LY largely due to prior 53rd week.

6) Takeaways
- Strong Q2 beat with healthy comps (+4%), EPS ($1.59), and margin expansion (+115 bps OM) as branded value strategy gains traction.
- 2H guides remain prudent (comps +2%–3%) given tougher compares and macro uncertainty; merch margin pressure to intensify as brand penetration rises.
- Offsets from productivity and cost actions (DC automation, store ops, domestic freight) are running ahead of plan and support raised FY EPS.
- Shrink remains a headwind; guidance assumes deterioration at Q3 true-up.
- Execution focus on ladies’ improvement, vendor expansion, and disciplined pricing to maintain sharp value amid a more promotional retail landscape.
