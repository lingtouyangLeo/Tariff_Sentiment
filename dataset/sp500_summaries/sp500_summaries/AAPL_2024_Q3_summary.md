4) Q&A Highlights
- iPhone cycle/AI:
  - Upgrade rates mid-cycle hard to call; Apple Intelligence seen as a compelling upgrade catalyst over multiple years
  - Too early to read post-WWDC demand mix shift to Pro/Pro Max; carriers’ promotion plans not disclosed
- China:
  - Greater China revenue -6.5% YoY (-<3% cc); improvement vs 1H; iPhone install base record; June quarter record for upgraders; iPhone 15 outperforming 14 on comparable weeks; majority of Mac/iPad buyers first-time purchasers; competitive environment remains intense
- Services momentum:
  - Driven by installed base growth and higher engagement: transacting and paid accounts at ATH; paid subs growing strong double digits
  - AI monetization: terms with partners (e.g., OpenAI) confidential; sees need for both on-device personal context and world-knowledge models
- Margins and components:
  - Guide reflects mix shifts and FX; memory costs up but broader commodity declines; margins remain at historically high levels
- Apple Intelligence rollout and regulation:
  - Staggered features/languages; active engagement with EU and China regulators; aim to move fast but comply
- Financial structure:
  - R&D/OpEx: Continued investment and skill redeployment to AI/ML; hybrid CapEx model (internal + partners)
  - Free cash flow margins structurally higher on revenue growth, margin expansion, and capital efficiency

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and optimistic on AI-driven product and services cycle; cautious pragmatism on FX and China competition
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Management positioning Apple Intelligence as a multi-year upgrade driver across iPhone, Mac, and iPad
  - Services growth expected to remain double digit; strong installed base engagement
- Cost outlook:
  - Memory inflation a watch item; otherwise benign commodity environment; margin guidance still elevated
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Services growth (14%) and record OCF were stronger than anticipated
  - iPad rebound (24% YoY) notable; China improved vs 1H
  - Guidance for similar YoY revenue growth into Sep quarter despite FX headwinds supports steady demand view

- iPhone trends are resilient: 15 family outpacing 14 on comparable weeks; installed base at ATH; China improved sequentially but remains highly competitive with FX/macro pressures.
- Services momentum is broad-based (subs >1B, strong engagement), underpinning durable double-digit growth; EU DMA changes adopted with limited overall impact so far.
- Watch items: FX headwinds, memory cost inflation, product mix effects on margins, regulatory timing for AI features in EU/China, and tough launch compares for certain hardware lines.
