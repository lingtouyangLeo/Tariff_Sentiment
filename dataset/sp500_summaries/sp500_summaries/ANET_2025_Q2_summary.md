3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/Products:
  - AI Centers strategy spanning:
    - Scale-up back-end (intra-rack accelerator interconnect; today largely proprietary NVLink; expects shift to Ethernet/UA-Link over next few years).
    - Scale-out back-end (rack-to-rack XPU interconnect; shift from InfiniBand to Ethernet per UltraEthernet).
    - Scale-out front-end (connects clusters to clouds, storage, WAN/DCI; Arista EOS + EtherLink).
  - EtherLink portfolio: 20+ products; focus on single point of control/visibility, maximizing GPU utilization.
  - Backend AI networking revenue target of $750M in 2025 “on track”; aggregate AI networking expected to exceed $1.5B in 2025.
  - Expanding beyond NVIDIA GPUs: early pilots with AMD MI-series, startups, and custom XPUs.
- M&A/Go-to-Market:
  - Acquiring VeloCloud (SD-WAN) to complete distributed enterprise/branch portfolio; strengthens MSP channel; SASE delivered via best-of-breed security partners (Arista to provide secure WAN/branch, partner on cloud security).
  - VeloCloud not material in 2025; focus on restoring revenue to pre-Broadcom levels and integrating model.
- Organization:
  - Todd Nightingale appointed President & COO, focusing on enterprise and operational excellence.
- Long-term ambition:
  - Targeting ~$10B revenue in 2026 (pulled forward by two years from prior 2028 expectation).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Competition:
  - Competitive landscape “unchanged” despite louder chatter (NVIDIA networking, white box); Arista differentiation cited in platform performance, features, and customer intimacy.
  - Coexistence with white box expected; Arista’s high operating margin driven by efficiency, not just pricing.
- Demand mix and drivers:
  - Guide raise (+$550M) driven by combined AI, cloud front-end refresh (100G→400G/800G), and enterprise campus momentum; VeloCloud minimal this year.
  - Back-end vs front-end increasingly converged; AI traffic patterns pressuring cloud front-end upgrades.
  - Deferred revenue volatility tied to AI projects, acceptance criteria, and experimentation cycles (12–24 months).
- Customer concentration:
  - Expect ≥10% contributions from at least two largest customers; broader base growing (neo-clouds, enterprise) in aggregate.
- Product/roadmap:
  - Scale-up Ethernet an incremental TAM; standards progress (Ethernet/UA-Link) could open market beyond proprietary NVLink.
  - Broadcom Tomahawk 6 in Arista labs; new product in 2026. Jericho 4 underpins 800G evolution of flagship 7800 spine for AI scale-out and WAN.
  - “Blue box” concept to complement white box with Arista-hardened hardware plus software in future.
- Sovereign AI:
  - One sovereign AI opportunity fell out (the “5th customer”) and is not included in 2025; remain cautiously optimistic for 2026+.
- AI titans:
  - Two hyperscalers nearing/at ~100k GPUs; third progressing; fourth earlier stage. Expect all four to adopt Arista back-end by 2026; front-end also benefits.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and execution-focused; characterized as a “once in a lifetime” opportunity in AI/cloud networking.
- Forward-looking:
  - Ethernet’s share gains in AI back-end expected to accelerate over 3–5 years.
  - Enterprise campus/branch and MSP route-to-market expanding with VeloCloud; SASE via partnerships.
  - Strong operating leverage expected to persist (FY25 OM ~48%).
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Significant FY25 revenue raise to +25% growth.
  - AI networking outlook now >$1.5B for 2025; back-end $750M “on track” despite loss of a sovereign AI customer.
  - VeloCloud acquisition announcement fills SD-WAN/branch gap.

6) Takeaways
- Arista posted record Q2 with broad-based strength and raised FY25 growth to 25%, signaling robust demand across AI, cloud (front-end refresh), and enterprise campus.
- AI remains the core growth engine: back-end revenue target of $750M in 2025 on track; aggregate AI networking to exceed $1.5B as Ethernet gains share over InfiniBand.
- VeloCloud adds SD-WAN/branch and MSP channel leverage; near-term immaterial but strategically completes distributed enterprise portfolio; SASE delivered via partners.
- Margins remain best-in-class (Q2 GM 65.6%, OM 48.8%) supported by supply chain efficiency and product mix; management asserts differentiation vs white box and sustained efficiency.
- Visibility improving (deferred revenue up to $4.1B), but acceptance clauses and AI experimentation add volatility; customer concentration remains with top two, though broader base is building.
