4) Q&A Highlights
- Supply chain/inventory:

  - Management believes iPhone would have grown YoY absent supply shortages; recapture timing/extent difficult to quantify
- Gross margin drivers:
  - Favorable mix (within products and Services), cost discipline, component cost benefits; FX still a headwind (sequential ~-50 bps in March guide), partly offset by cost actions
- China demand:
  - Notable December improvement in traffic and demand vs. November amid reopening
- Installed base dynamics:
  - Installed base up ~150M YoY to >2B; strong growth in emerging markets; increasing engagement with higher conversion from transacting to paid accounts
- Services growth drivers:
  - Larger installed base, rising engagement, expanding reach (e.g., Apple Pay in ~70 markets), and new services
- India strategy:
  - Strong double-digit growth; retail presence and affordability initiatives to unlock further demand
- iPhone mix/ASPs:
  - Strong Pro cycle; customers stretch for “best they can afford” given centrality of iPhone in daily life
- Mac outlook:
  - Near-term challenged with industry contraction; long-term advantaged by low share + Apple Silicon
- AI:
  - Strategic priority; broad application across portfolio; enhances features and services
