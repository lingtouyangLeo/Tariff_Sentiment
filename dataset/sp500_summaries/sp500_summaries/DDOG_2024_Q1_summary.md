  - Net revenue retention: mid-110s; gross revenue retention: mid–high 90s (stable).
- Billings & RPO:
  - Billings: $618M, +21% YoY; seasonally lower sequentially after a strong Q4.

  - Other guidance items: 2024 net interest/other income ~$110M; cash taxes $20–$25M; capex + capitalized software 3–4% of revenue.

Management Commentary
- Platform adoption and product breadth:
  - Multi‑product use continues to rise: 82% use ≥2 products; 47% ≥4; 23% ≥6; 10% ≥8.
  - Products outside core Infra/APM/Logs now exceed $200M ARR; 12 products launched 2020–2022 contribute ~11% of ARR; 8 of those >$10M ARR.
  - Database Monitoring already ~1% of revenue; strong early traction. Cloud Cost Management now supports GCP and exceeds $10M ARR.
- AI and AIOps:
  - Bits AI for Incident Management GA; event management GA (core AIOps building block); 2,000 customers using AI integrations; AI‑native customers ~3.5% of ARR (up from ~3%).
  - Added NVIDIA Triton Inference Server integration; LLM/application monitoring in design partner phase; more to come.
- Logs and SIEM:
  - Error tracking for logs GA; enhanced full‑text search and advanced sub‑queries.
  - FlexLogs (separates storage/compute) in limited availability; already >$10M ARR; strong interest for audit/security/compliance use cases.
  - Investing in Cloud SIEM to capture SIEM/log consolidation opportunities.
- Digital experience & Dev/test:
  - Mobile app testing GA (no‑code testing on real devices).
- Cloud service management:
  - Event Management + Watchdog + Bits AI + workflow automation positioned as a full AI‑driven remediation/prevention loop.
- Go-to-market:
  - Multiple 6–7 figure expansions/lands across online grocery, medical device, apparel, automotive, industrial, and communications infrastructure—often consolidating several tools into Datadog and expanding to 7–14 products.
- Investment posture:
  - Hiring re‑accelerating in Sales & Marketing and R&D; Opex +14% YoY (vs. +10% in Q4). Maintaining recruiting engine to support long‑term growth.

Q&A Highlights
- Cloud correlation and AI:
  - Long‑term correlation with hyperscalers remains, but timing differs; Datadog tied more to production/inference than to training GPU capacity spikes.
  - April trends: sequential growth higher than the prior‑year April; management cautions one month doesn’t make a quarter.
- Customer behavior:
  - Usage growth accelerated among larger and multi‑million‑spend customers; both cloud‑native and large enterprise cohorts improved.
  - Consolidation trend ongoing; lag between consolidation wins and revenue as workloads migrate over quarters/years.
  - More multi‑year commitments (higher CRPO); revenue remains usage‑driven; ARR is the best forward indicator.
- Sales capacity:
  - Increasing sales capacity; recruiting engine ramping; long‑term capacity calibrated to revenue/ARR growth.
- Product traction:
  - Newer products (e.g., Cloud Cost Mgmt, Database Monitoring) have broad appeal; network monitoring skewed to larger enterprises.
  - Security packaging changes seeing good early uptake; announced agent‑led scanning for infra security (beta); “thousands of customers” on security with growth across pillars.
- Financials/guidance:
  - Q2 guide reflects conservatism; not a function of pulled‑in deals.
  - Billings/RPO variability acknowledged; sequential billings decel after strong Q4 is seasonal/lumpy.
  - Margin guide lower vs. Q1 due to stepped‑up investments; no unusual one‑time items.
  - Commit/overage posture consistent (clients under‑commit and grow into usage; on‑demand/overage upper‑teens to mid‑20s% of mix historically).
- Leadership:
  - President Amit stepping down from operating role; joining Board; may emerge as VC investor; remains close to company.
- M&A:
  - Open to larger M&A but highly selective on fit/economics; strong cash generation provides flexibility.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends:
  - Sequential usage growth improved; optimization abating; strong adoption of newer products; international outpacing North America.
  - Multi‑year commitments increasing—positive signal on platform consolidation and customer confidence.
- Cost/investment outlook:
  - Continued efficiency gains in cloud COGS; reinvesting in headcount and product pipeline; near‑term operating margins step down from Q1 levels.
- Capital allocation:
  - Healthy cash ($2.8B) and FCF support organic investment and potential M&A.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Revenue beat and usage re‑acceleration; sequential ARR dollars added highest since Q4’21; CRPO +52% YoY.
  - Q2/FY revenue growth guided to ~22–23% (conservative stance despite strong Q1 momentum).

Takeaways
- Platform consolidation and multi‑product adoption are accelerating, especially among larger customers, driving durable ARR growth.
- Usage trends improved sequentially and optimization pressures are moderating; NRR stable in the mid‑110s.
- Strong product cadence (AIOps/event management, FlexLogs, Cloud Cost Mgmt, DB Monitoring) expanding TAM beyond core observability.
- International growth and multi‑year commitments are rising; sales capacity investments are ramping to capture demand.
- Near‑term operating margins guided lower due to deliberate investment; guidance remains conservative despite strong leading indicators.

Other Notable Information
- Dash user conference in late June (NYC); expected cost ~$11M in Q2.
- Geographic mix: international revenue growth outpaced North America.
- Linearity: March usage growth > Jan/Feb; typical seasonal pattern.
- Current product adoption stats: 82% of customers use ≥2 products; 47% ≥4; 23% ≥6; 10% ≥8.
- Security: new agent‑led scanning (beta); packaging changes showing early traction.
- Logs/SIEM: enhanced queries; FlexLogs >$10M ARR; SIEM consolidation opportunity expected to build over the next year, not immediate quarters.
