4) Q&A Highlights
- Themes:
  - Apple Intelligence: strong early interest; upgrade driver; staged feature/language rollout through December and into 2025; developer APIs live.
  - iPhone demand/supply: 16 Pro family constrained in October but expected to unwind soon; too early to call mix; management aims for supply/demand balance quickly.
  - Margins/costs: GM guided 46–47%; broader commodities trending down, but NAND/DRAM up in Sep and expected up in Dec; company still at record-level margins despite tech upgrades.
  - Services durability: recurring subscriptions growing faster than transactional; well over 1B paid subs; run-rate ~$100B.
  - China/regions: China flat YoY with sequential FX help; installed base at ATH; Europe +11% with strength in Western Europe and emerging markets (Turkey, Middle East, India at all-time record).
  - Capex & R&D: Hybrid data center model; AI-related capex ongoing; R&D intensity already high with internal reallocation to AI projects.
  - Legal & policy: Declined to speculate on tariffs or DOJ/Google outcomes.
  - Capital allocation: Business-first deployment; excess cash returned; net cash $50B remains; philosophy unchanged.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals

- Demand trends:
  - iOS 18.1 adoption doubled vs prior year’s 17.1 in first three days, indicating strong engagement.
  - iPhone 16 Pro supply tightness near-term but improving; suggests healthy demand.

- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Strong GM despite numerous new features/products.
  - Services crossing ~$100B run-rate; recurring mix leading growth.
