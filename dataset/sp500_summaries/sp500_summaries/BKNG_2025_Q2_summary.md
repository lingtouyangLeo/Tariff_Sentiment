Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives:
  - Alternative accommodations (AA): Listings at Booking.com reached 8.4M (+8% YoY). AA room nights +10% YoY; AA mix 37% (+1 ppt). Enhancements include strengthened payments, request-to-book with pre-booking messaging (API), and ongoing supply expansion.
  - Genius loyalty: Extending across verticals; experimenting with premium features (e.g., dedicated agents). L2/L3 users now >30% of active travelers and account for ~50% of Booking.com room nights. L2/L3 mix in room nights in mid-50% over last 4 quarters, and these users are more direct and higher frequency.
  - Connected Trip: Transactions +>30% YoY; now low-double-digit % of Booking.com transactions. Non-accommodation growth robust: Flights tickets >16M in Q2 (+44% YoY); Attractions tickets >2x (from modest base).
  - Asia: Two-brand strategy (Agoda + Booking.com) with localization, broader Flights/Attractions, tailored payments, and language support; Asia room nights up low double digits. China domestic/outbound remains deprioritized; inbound to China remains a niche strength.
  - AI/GenAI: Active deployment across brands:
    - Priceline “Penny” assistant enhancements (incl. voice), improving engagement and conversion.
    - Kayak.ai personalization/conversation tests.
    - OpenTable AI Concierge launched, embedded in restaurant profiles.
    - CS: GenAI reduced live agent contacts; voice-enabled agents improved resolution times and CSAT; agent-assist tools (e.g., auto-summarization, guided workflows).
    - Partnerships with OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon; Booking.com highlighted in OpenAI Agent Mode demos.
  - Payments: Identified as strategic glue for Connected Trip—value to travelers/partners, pricing competitiveness, and P&L contribution.
- Direct and app:
  - B2C direct mix mid-60% over last four quarters (from low-60% last year).
  - App mix mid-50% of room nights over last four quarters (from low-50%); majority of app bookings are direct.

Q&A Highlights
- Asia: Broad strength; management does not break out countries; reiterated limited ambitions in China domestic/outbound; confident in long-term high-single-digit industry growth, aiming to outpace.
- LLMs/traffic channels: Too early to quantify LLM-driven channel diversification; Google clicks still growing slightly for accommodations; ramping social media spend (+25% YoY); deep partnerships with hyperscalers and inclusion in ChatGPT Agent Mode.
- U.S. growth and consumer: Multiple incremental initiatives (product, supply, marketing, brand, AA) to gain share; Q2 grew slightly faster than Q1 and likely outpaced U.S. market. Mixed signals: lower ADRs, shorter LOS and booking window; strength at higher-income segment (5-star, international to Europe); pressure at lower-end domestic. International outbound stronger than domestic.
- Alternative accommodations: Still outgrowing hotels across regions; reaching greater maturity (8.4M listings). Mgmt estimates ~75% of the largest player in room nights (ex-experiences). Focus remains on serving traveler preferences across all accommodation types.
- Connected Trip build-out: Ongoing inventory scaling across all verticals; real value from data, personalization, and payments. Economics benefit from single acquisition cost across multiple verticals and higher loyalty/return direct traffic.
- Outlook cadence: Q3 moderation largely due to tougher comps in Aug/Sep 2024; emphasized focusing on full-year outlook (raised at midpoint).
- GenAI product performance: Natural language search and other features are retained based on test-driven uplift; conversion specifics not disclosed. Scale enables parallel innovation across brands.
- P&L philosophy: “Double discipline”—drive operating leverage and reinvest into highest-ROI growth vectors (GenAI, fintech/payments, verticals, advertising). FY25: ~$150M in transformation savings; ~$170M reinvestment program.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on execution and long-term growth levers; cautious on macro/geopolitical and U.S. lower-end consumer; pragmatic on tough comps.
- Demand trends: Steady into Q3; Europe resilient with earlier booking and higher prices; Asia strengthened sequentially; U.S. mixed but share-gain narrative intact.
- Cost/digital mix: Continued marketing leverage via higher direct/app mix; scaling social channels; payments supports monetization and partner value.
- Surprises vs expectations: Q2 beat on room nights, gross bookings, revenue, and EBITDA (revenue outpaced gross bookings due to payments and lower Q2 merchandising spend); raised full-year margin expansion target to ~125 bps.

Takeaways
- Q2 outperformance across key metrics with strong operating leverage; FX tailwind aided reported growth.
- Strategic flywheel gaining momentum: Alternative accommodations, Flights/Attractions, Genius, Payments, and GenAI are driving Connected Trip adoption (>30% YoY transactions; low double-digit mix).
- U.S. remains the softest region but likely gaining share; high-end traveler healthy, lower-end cautious.
- Guidance prudent on Q3 comps, but full-year outlook raised (LD growth bookings/revenue; mid-teens EBITDA; margin expansion ~125 bps).
- Execution focus: scaling direct/app, payments as underpinning, AI-enabled personalization and service, and disciplined reinvestment.

Other Notable Information
