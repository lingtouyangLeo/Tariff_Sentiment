  - Broad-based growth with strength in MedTech; some transitory softness in international pediatric nutrition and Core Lab China.
  - Management highlighted diversified portfolio resiliency, continued gross margin expansion initiatives, and a rich pipeline entering 2025.
  - Macro/industry: China volume-based procurement (VBP) impacted Core Lab pricing/timing; CGM remains a mass-market growth opportunity; U.S. structural heart capacity not seen as a bottleneck.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q3 results:
  - Organic sales growth: +7.6% (+8.2% excluding COVID testing)
  - Adjusted EPS: $1.21
  - Adjusted gross margin: 56.3%

  - FX: -2.5% YoY headwind to sales; modestly better than July rates
- Guidance and outlook:
  - Q4 2024 adjusted EPS guidance: $1.31–$1.37
  - Q4 FX expected to be <1% headwind to reported sales
  - Management reiterated confidence in meeting elevated full-year outlook; gross margin improvement on track for ~+75 bps in 2024 vs. 2023

3) Management Commentary
- Segment performance and strategy:
  - Nutrition: +3.5% overall; strong U.S. pediatric (+12%) and adult (+11.5%) offset by international pediatric softness due to commercial execution (share loss and inventory alignment). Corrective actions taken; expect Q4 step-up.
  - Diagnostics:
    - Core Lab: +4.5% ex-COVID; underlying demand healthy; China VBP impacted Q3 timing/pricing. Large account wins support 2025.
    - Rapid/POC: Expanding menus; leveraging at-home respiratory trends; launched Big Ten blood donation partnership to address low U.S. blood supply.
  - Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD): +7%, broad-based across LatAm, SE Asia, Middle East; advancing biosimilars via partnerships with first launches in EM by late 2025.
  - MedTech: >+13%
    - Diabetes Care (CGM): >$1.6B sales, +21% (U.S. +26%); Libre connectivity expanded via Medtronic AID partnership (now five pump partners). Lingo (OTC glucose sensor) launched in U.S. with strong early interest/reorders; cost/scale leadership prioritized for long-term margin and access.
    - Electrophysiology: +14%; broad-based catheters/mapping growth. Completed enrollment (ahead of plan) in Volt AF U.S. IDE (PFA). Initiated Focal Flex trial (dual-energy PFA+RF) and launched Advisor HD GridX mapping catheter.
    - Structural Heart: >+16%; share gains in TAVR; accelerating adoption of Amulet and TriClip. CMS initiated NCD process for TriClip.
    - Rhythm Management: +7% (Aveir leadless pacer, Assert ICM).
    - Heart Failure: +14% (chronic and temporary support).
    - Vascular: +5% (vessel closure, coronary imaging, Esprit BTK stent U.S. launch).
    - Neuromodulation: +5% (Eterna SCS internationally).
- Margin/capital:
  - Targeted investments (MedTech, Diagnostics) with discipline; operating expenses down as % of sales since 2019; focus on gross margin expansion.
  - New $7B share repurchase authorization; ~$750M repurchased in Q3; aim is balanced capital allocation and support of dividend—EPS growth to be driven primarily by top line and margin.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Guidance bridge: Q3 shortfalls in international pediatric nutrition (execution) and Core Lab China (VBP timing) viewed as transitory; diversified portfolio outperformance (devices) offset. Strong confidence in Q4 revenue acceleration and EPS guide; guidance raised third time this year.
- CGM market:
  - ABT reiterates $10B Libre target by 2028; 2024 +20% growth and $6B+ revenue outlook for Libre; adding ~1M users and ~$1B revenue this year.
  - Market fundamentals intact; cost/scale/tech leadership remain key; new manufacturing line and a new plant coming online, resolving temporary Libre3 supply constraints.
  - Lingo: early U.S. DTC traction with high reorder rates; two-sensor pack most popular.
- 2025 framing:
  - High-single-digit top-line and ~10% EPS growth seen as a reasonable starting point; “COVID cloud” largely behind. Expect continued margin expansion and pipeline contribution (new launches to contribute ~$1B in 2024, set to step up again in 2025).
- Structural Heart capacity: No systemic bottlenecks seen; hospitals investing; ABT expanding field force to support growth.
- NEC/infant formula litigation: FDA/CDC/NIH joint statement says preterm formula is standard of care and no conclusive causal link to NEC. ABT stands behind products; concerned about regulatory process being disregarded in litigation—seeks faster resolution, signals unwillingness to shoulder indefinite U.S. liability if science/regulation are ignored.
- EP/PFA: PFA catalyzing market expansion and mapping usage (>90% of PFA cases mapped; mapping now >50% of RF). RF still key (esp. non-de novo/redo/VT/SVT). ABT pursuing full-portfolio (mapping + PFA + RF).
- LAA/Tricuspid outlook: Amulet growing (global +25%, U.S. +40%); strong registry outcomes; Catalyst RCT vs anticoagulants completes 2025; Amulet 2.0 trial to start by YE24. TriClip supported by RCTs; NCD process could expand U.S. access; tricuspid seen as $1B opportunity over time.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand/mix:
  - Strong MedTech momentum (CGM, Structural Heart, EP). Diagnostics stable ex-China VBP; Nutrition U.S. strong; international pediatric to recover post fixes.
- Cost/margins:
  - Committed to sustained gross margin expansion; CGM cost leadership and scale support both access and margins; depreciation roll-off aids CGM margins.
- Capital allocation:
  - New buyback authorization underscores confidence and perceived valuation disconnect; dividend remains core.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Devices outperformed; nutrition and diagnostics below some expectations, but issues identified as one-time or timing-related; maintained full-year confidence and raised outlook earlier.

6) Takeaways
- MedTech is the growth engine: CGM +21% (U.S. +26%), Structural Heart >+16%, EP +14% underpin strong top-line and 2025 momentum.
- Transitory headwinds: International pediatric nutrition (execution) and Core Lab China VBP impacted Q3; corrective actions and timing normalization expected to lift Q4.
- Margin expansion on track: Gross margin up ~75 bps in 2024; disciplined opex and scale/cost leadership (notably in CGM) support ongoing operating leverage.
- 2025 setup constructive: High-single-digit sales and ~10% EPS growth viewed as reasonable starting point, with pipeline/launches set to contribute more than in 2024 and “COVID comps” fading.
- Litigation watch: Strong U.S. agency statement on NEC supports ABT stance; legal process outcomes still uncertain—management signals desire for faster resolution and unwillingness to absorb indefinite U.S. liability if regulation/science are sidelined.
