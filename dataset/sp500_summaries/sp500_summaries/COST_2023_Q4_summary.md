1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)
- Period: Fiscal 4Q23 (17 weeks ended September 3, 2023) and FY23
- Macro/industry context cited:
  - Inflation eased to an estimated 1–2% YoY in Q4 and trended downward through the quarter; fresh largely flat, food & sundries up slightly (CPG), non-foods benefiting from lower freight and some commodity costs (e.g., steel)
  - Gas price volatility; gasoline deflation weighed on comps and ticket
  - Consumer remains value-seeking; big-ticket discretionary still soft
  - Wage pressure persists industry-wide; Costco reiterates higher-wage, high-benefit positioning
  - Competitive set: Sam’s noted as the most direct and improving competitor; Costco claims share gains in many non-foods

  - LIFO expected minimal ahead if disinflation persists
  - Inflation trending lower; watch oil

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/initiatives:
  - Digital/mobile transformation: redesigned account page and digital membership card; improved app header/search; added in-app messaging/ads; launched optical digital store (virtual try-on, pickup); soon: warehouse inventory search and barcode scanning in app
  - KPIs: App rating up from 2.3 to 4.7; unique site visitors +40%; app installs +46% YoY
  - E-commerce merchandising: big-ticket discretionary declines moderating; appliances up >30% online; “gold bars” sell out quickly (limit 2)
  - Costco Next (curated drop-ship marketplace): 62 suppliers across multiple categories; low customer issues
  - Assortment moves: added 40–50 small-ticket indulgent/impulse items to lift basket
  - Omnichannel/last mile: Instacart partnership expanding (U.S./Canada; some non-food and Rx); sales counted in warehouse, not e-comm
  - EV charging: pilots underway; Costco intends lower pricing if fees apply
- International expansion: China 5 locations now; 2 more planned in FY24 (incl. Shenzhen early CY24), to 7 total; strong grand openings
- Risks/challenges:
  - Big-ticket discretionary softness; ticket down
  - Gasoline price volatility
  - Higher labor costs; SG&A deleverage with lower sales growth
  - Higher effective tax rate driven by international mix
  - Macro uncertainty (oil near $100; student loan repayment backdrop)

4) Q&A Highlights
- Membership fee increase: “When, not if”; timing not disclosed; macro and member value considered; loyalty metrics strong
- Inflation/deflation and elasticity: Q4 inflation 1–2% and easing; fresh flat; food & sundries up slightly; non-foods down on freight/commodities; Costco intends to lower prices quickly; unit elasticity improving in places but less predictable than pre-pandemic
- Labor/SG&A: Will not reduce service; wages and benefits remain a priority; SG&A leverage threshold historically ~4.5–5% comp; some deleverage acceptable
- Margin outlook: No major new puts/takes besides LIFO normalization; “steady as she goes”
- Gasoline economics: Still strong profit; spread vs. competitors improved to mid-$0.30/gal on average; down from record last year but solid contributor
- Capital allocation: Special dividend is also “when, not if”; higher interest on cash (~5%) mildly discourages immediate action, but not strategic goal to hoard cash
- U.S. footprint runway: Can add ~150 U.S. warehouses over next decade; increased infill opportunity
- Omnichannel operations: No scan-and-go planned; limited BOPIS tests for select big-ticket (e.g., TVs)
- International member dynamics: New Asia clubs open with large signups (50–100k; Shanghai >200k), first-year renewals mid-to-high 50s then build to mid-70s over time
- Category color: Gaming strong; some Apple, tablets, audio up; TV units up with lower ASPs; notebooks/PCs still down; early holiday seasonal trending well
- Vendor-funded promotions: P&G gift-card style offer growing; broader CPG promo support increasing

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand and mix:
  - Strong traffic; ticket pressured by gas deflation and big-ticket softness
  - Holiday/seasonal off to a good early start; appliances and gaming healthy; TVs price deflation
- Cost/inflation:
  - Freight down; some commodities down; potential deflation tailwind to LIFO reserve ($450–$500M) if it materializes
  - Wages elevated by design; service levels maintained
- Capital allocation:
  - Cash robust; optionality for special dividend remains
  - Membership fee hike remains a lever; timing cautious given macro
- Surprises/notes:
  - Solid gross margin expansion despite SG&A deleverage and soft discretionary
  - Executive member growth (+981k in 17 weeks) and membership fee income growth strong
  - E-comm improving trends; Costco Next ramping; app engagement materially better

6) Takeaways
- Traffic resilience and membership strength offset softness in big-ticket discretionary; comps ex gas/FX remained healthy.
- Margin quality improved: fewer markdowns and LIFO easy comp drove gross margin expansion despite wage-driven SG&A deleverage.
- Inflation easing with potential for further disinflation; Costco intends to lead on price cuts; elasticity is improving but less predictable than pre-COVID.
- Digital and marketplace progress (app overhaul, optical digital store, Costco Next) plus Instacart deepen engagement; e-comm trends are improving.
- Capital allocation levers intact: membership fee hike and special dividend are “when, not if,” but timing remains deliberately cautious; expansion runway robust (mid-to-high 20s openings in FY24; ~150 more U.S. warehouses over 10 years).
