*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW)
- Period: Q1 2024 (core results unless noted)
- Context and market backdrop:
  - Management believes Q1 is the trough for 2024; order activity and utilization trends are improving.
  - Optical Communications: Carrier inventory drawdowns are moderating; order rates rising; enterprise demand to benefit from AI data center builds; BEAD funding approvals expected late 2024, spend in 2025.
  - Display: Panel maker utilization increased late Q1 and expected to remain higher in Q2; retail TV units roughly flat YoY, continued TV screen-size growth, and some PC demand recovery.
  - Currency: Yen remains weak; Corning hedged at a core rate of ¥107 through 2024 and plans to pair extended hedging with further yen-based price increases to maintain returns.
  - Auto: New EPA multi‑pollutant standards likely to require gasoline particulate filters (GPF) on U.S. gasoline vehicles/hybrids by MY27, increasing Corning content per ICE vehicle 2–3x.
  - Life Sciences: Ongoing inventory digestion in North America/Europe.
  - Solar: Lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon.

  - Free cash flow: +$300M YoY improvement
- Segment performance (YoY):
  - Optical Communications: $930M, -17%; NI $100M, -37%
  - Display Technologies: $872M, +14%; NI $201M, +26%; Q1 glass price flat QoQ; Q2 profitability to improve as production normalizes

  - Q2 free cash flow: +~$300M sequentially
  - 2024 CapEx: ~ $1.2B
  - Display: Q2 glass price expected flat QoQ; panel utilization to run higher; pricing environment “favorable”

3) Management Commentary
- Growth/strategy and product updates:
  - Framework reiterated: (1) Q1 is the low for the year; (2) add >$3B annualized sales within 3 years; (3) deliver strong incrementals with existing capacity/capabilities.
  - AI data center opportunity: Passive optical connectivity for GPU back-end networks; pre-connectorized structured cabling enables faster deployment; attach revenue “low single-digit hundreds of dollars per GPU.” New high-density innovations include:
    - Rocket Ribbon Cable with Flow Ribbon: up to ~60% cable diameter reduction; fibers per cable approaching ~7,000.
    - Contour optical fiber: ~40% smaller cross-sectional area vs legacy fibers.
  - Automotive: GPF leadership positions Corning for incremental hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. growth; ongoing momentum in automotive glass solutions across ICE and BEV platforms.
  - Mobile consumer electronics: Strategy to outgrow unit markets via higher content per device; continued innovation pipeline.
  - Display: Leadership and scale (Gen 10.5) aligned with larger-screen TV trends; expect to capture retail volume growth from screen-size expansion.
  - New platforms: U.S. solar supply localization and pharmaceutical packaging among emerging opportunities.
- Profitability levers:
  - Since Q4’22, pricing actions and productivity improvements expanded gross margin by ~320 bps despite ~$400M lower sales; costs/capability already in P&L to support >$3B additional sales, setting up operating leverage.
- Risks/challenges noted:
  - Carriers’ muted 2024 deployment outlook even as destocking fades.
  - Yen volatility beyond 2024; hedging and yen price increases to protect returns.
  - Life sciences destocking; North American heavy-duty diesel softness through 2024; polysilicon price pressure.
  - BEAD timing and execution; AI data center power/energy availability constraints; China consumer stimulus impact uncertain.

4) Q&A Highlights
- AI data centers:
  - Timing: Back-half 2024 revenue impact as GPU clusters are built.
  - Density: GPU racks need ~8x more fibers vs typical CPU front-end racks (e.g., ~256 vs ~32 fibers per rack).
  - B100 and rising density/bandwidth push photonics closer to the GPU, opening new product categories (including flat-glass-based coupling solutions).
- Optical Communications:
  - Carriers: 5G economics are challenging; operators consolidating wireline/wireless networks to lower costs. Corning assumes muted deployments but expects uplift as destocking ends; order book improved sequentially.
  - Enterprise/data center siting near power: Corning’s global footprint is an advantage; too early to quantify.
  - BEAD: Allocations likely in 2024, spend in 2025; Corning taking a conservative view on timing.
- Display:
  - Cycle behavior: China-centric panel makers optimizing utilization to manage pricing and inventory, potentially smoothing historic volatility.
  - Q2: Meaningful sequential volume improvement as utilization increases; glass price flat QoQ.
  - Yen hedging: Partial 2025 hedges in place; will blend hedges with yen price increases to sustain “appropriate” returns; too early to set a new core rate for 2025.
- Specialty Materials:
  - 2024 unit markets: Smartphones flattish; IT mid-single-digit growth; near-term growth driven more by content gains than unit recovery; larger innovation catalysts likely in the following model year.
- Financial cadence:
  - Margins: Starting around ~37% gross margin; expect sequential improvement as sales rise; “38% is the new 40%” post-inflation/pricing, but management still targets ~40% over time.
  - OpEx: Aim to keep roughly flat around $700–$725M per quarter, creating operating leverage; Q1 higher due to normalized variable comp.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and constructive; reiterated “march up” across 2024 from a stronger profitability/FCF base.
- Demand outlook:
  - Optical: Q1 seen as inflection; sequential growth in carrier and enterprise ahead of normal seasonality; AI pipeline/wins accumulating.
  - Display: Utilization higher into Q2; favorable pricing; screen-size-driven volume growth.
  - Auto: Regulatory tailwinds for GPF; glass solutions building momentum.
- Capital allocation:
  - Strong balance sheet (avg debt maturity ~23 years; ~$1B due over 5 years).
  - Dividend growth of ~40% since 2019; top-quartile yield; opportunistic share repurchases.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Q1 EPS and revenue landed at the high end; optical orders improved earlier than typical seasonality; explicit AI attach revenue commentary per GPU.

6) Takeaways
- Q1 likely trough; Q2 guide signals sequential improvement in sales, EPS, and FCF, with Display profitability rebounding as production normalizes.
- >$3B sales uplift over the next three years to come largely from existing capacity, positioning Corning for outsized incremental margins and FCF.
- Optical demand is set to improve as carrier destocking abates; AI data center builds should add enterprise momentum in H2’24 and beyond.
- Display returns to benefit from higher panel utilization and favorable pricing; yen headwinds to be mitigated via hedging plus yen price increases.
- Regulatory (EPA GPF) and secular (screen-size growth, AI connectivity) tailwinds offset pockets of weakness (life sciences destocking, heavy-duty diesel, polysilicon pricing).

7) Other Notable Information
- Currency hedging program has delivered >$2.5B cumulative cash since inception; yen core rate of 107 through 2024; forward curve supportive for future hedging.
- Leadership: EVP and Chief Strategy Officer Jeff Evenson to retire end of May.
- Investor events: Annual meeting May 2; presenting at JPMorgan Technology Conference May 21; management investor visits planned.
