  - CET1: 10.5% at YE; target range unchanged (10–11%); returned $5.3B to shareholders in 2023.
  - Guidance excludes potential sizable gain from sale of the “certified” business (expected close in Q2; reinvest majority of proceeds).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Focus on premium customers with diversified revenue (fees, spend, lending); fee revenues as a fast-growing, subscription-like component.
  - Strong acquisition engine: ~25M new proprietary accounts over two years; >70% on fee-based products.
  - Millennials/Gen Z: >60% of new consumer accounts in 2023; 75% of new U.S. Platinum/Gold; Q4 spend from this cohort +15% (now a sizable portion of total spend).
  - Product innovation and refresh cycle: ~40 global refreshes planned in 2024; no pre-announcement on U.S. Platinum timing.
  - Partnership ecosystem remains a differentiator (e.g., Delta co-brand strength).
- Risks/Challenges:
  - Softer airline spend in Q4; broader spend normalization.
  - SME organic spend remains modest; awaiting rebound.
  - Credit metrics normalizing; reserve rate to drift modestly higher in 2024.
  - Currency impacts (Argentina devaluation hit Q4 Opex).
  - Regulatory uncertainty (Basel “Endgame”); management engaging with regulators; no immediate change to capital approach.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Spend/bookings:
  - 2024 planning assumes spend trends similar to recent quarters; upside possible.
  - T&E: Q4 softness concentrated in airlines; bookings remain strong; management not concerned based on current signals.
- Revenue/NII drivers:
  - Discount revenue to track billed business; card fees to remain key growth driver with potential acceleration by year-end; NII growth moderates as tenured balances normalize.
  - NII relatively insensitive to rate cuts; company slightly liability-sensitive, but overall impact expected to be small; beta path uncertain.
- SME dynamics:
  - Organic spend soft across industry; acquisition, retention, and credit remain strong; positioned for rebound.
- Loans/credit:
  - ~70% of loan growth from tenured customers (>12 months on book); limited promotional balances; positive selection continues.
  - Reserve rate to tick up modestly due to normalization, not deteriorating mix; Pay Over Time and co-brands (e.g., Delta) are fast-growing with strong credit profiles.
- Costs:
  - Variable engagement expense to run slightly above revenue growth due to premium mix; natural hedges help when T&E softens.
  - Opex targeted flat in 2024; marketing to flex with demand; positive operating leverage expected.
- Capital/Basel:
  - CET1 within 10–11% target; dividend raised; ongoing buybacks; engaging with regulators on Basel; no changes to capital framework anticipated near term.
- Acquisition cadence:
  - 2.9M new cards in Q4; expectation to stay around 2.9–3.1M per quarter as long as quality demand persists; current growth more from new acquisitions than organic (esp. SME).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident in business model durability and long-term 10%+ revenue, mid-teens EPS aspiration; cautious near-term on spend normalization and airline softness.
- Demand trends:
  - Millennials/Gen Z momentum strong; international growth robust; SME rebound a key potential upside.
  - Delta co-brand continues strong (FY billings +15%).
- Cost outlook:
  - Tight Opex control; marketing to increase but remain efficient; variable engagement elevated with premiumization but managed.
- Capital allocation:
  - Steady buybacks within CET1 target; dividend up >15% QoQ and >60% since 2022 plan inception.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Q4 variable customer engagement and marketing lower than planned due to softer T&E.
  - Opex higher from specific items (merchant reserve, FX in Argentina).
  - Guidance aligns with long-term targets; excludes potential gain on business sale.
