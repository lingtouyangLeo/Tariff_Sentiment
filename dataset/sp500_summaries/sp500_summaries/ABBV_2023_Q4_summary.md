1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV); Quarter: Q4 2023; Fiscal Year: 2023
- Context:
  - Successfully navigated the largest LOE in industry history (Humira US biosimilars in 2023), with base-business (ex-Humira) strength offsetting declines.
  - Management raised R&D investment materially in 2023 (+~$600M) and will increase again in 2024 to support a broad late-stage pipeline.
  - Strategic expansion via pending acquisitions: ImmunoGen (Elahere; ADCs for solid tumors) and Cerevel (differentiated neuroscience pipeline), expected to close mid-2024.
  - Macro/industry: China aesthetics softness persists; U.S. aesthetics recovering. IRA impacts and Part D redesign factored into outlook; Medicare negotiation process underway (Imbruvica).

3) Management Commentary
- Growth Platform:
  - 2023 ex-Humira portfolio grew >8% for the year; accelerated to >15% in Q4.
  - 2024: Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, Ubrelvy/Qulipta expected to grow double-digit; aesthetics to grow meaningfully as U.S. recovers and OUS executes (offset near-term China softness).
- Long-term Outlook:
  - Return to robust revenue growth in 2025; high single-digit CAGR through 2029.
  - Skyrizi + Rinvoq now expected to exceed $27B sales in 2027 (Skyrizi >$17B; Rinvoq >$10B), up >$6B vs prior guide; combined ~$16B in 2024.
  - Oral CGRP peak sales raised to >$3B (+~$1B).
  - Aesthetics targeted >$9B by decade-end; unchanged long-term views for Vraylar and ABBV-951.
- Strategic/BD:
  - ImmunoGen acquisition accelerates entry into solid tumors (Elahere) and builds ADC scale; Cerevel augments neuroscience.
  - Ongoing focus on early-stage BD across core areas; financial flexibility maintained.
- Pipeline Highlights:
  - Immunology: Positive Ph2 for ludicizumab (anti-IL-1α/β) in HS; Ph3 HS in 2024; exploring UC/CD (biomarker-driven and combo with Skyrizi). Anticipated 2024 approvals: Skyrizi in UC. Rinvoq 2nd-wave Ph3s in GCA (data 2024), lupus, HS, alopecia areata, vitiligo.
  - Oncology: Epkinly FL 3L+ approvals expected 2024; Venclexta VERONA in higher-risk MDS data 2H24 (filings/approvals in 2025). ABBV-383 (BCMA×CD3) to Ph3 in 3L MM in 2024; combos in earlier lines in 2025. Teliso-V Phase 2 positive in NSCLC; aiming for accelerated approval filing in 2H24. ABBV-400 (next-gen cMET ADC) Phase 1 NSCLC/GE data in 2024; Ph3 3L CRC planned 2024. Anti-GARP ABBV-151 expanding Phase 2s.
  - Neuroscience: ABBV-951 (subQ levodopa/carbidopa) launched in Japan/EU; U.S. decision expected Q2 2024. Alzheimer’s assets: Aβ mAb 916 (aiming for long half-life, potency, lower ARIA; data late 2024/early 2025), SV2A oral 552 (cognition; data late 2024/early 2025), imraclidine (from Cerevel) in elderly; TREM2 (AL002; partner) Phase 2 data later (all patients enrolled).
  - Aesthetics: US BLA submitted for Botox platysma prominence (decision 2H24). Bonti (short-acting toxin) filing 2H24; potential approval near end of 2025.
- Capital Allocation: Dividend up >285% since inception; strong FCF supports dividend growth, debt paydown, and BD.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Immunology durability: Significant headroom in bio-penetration and line-of-therapy expansion across PSO/AD/IBD; robust market growth (AD mid-teens; IBD high-single digits; rheum low-single digits). Post-2027 growth skewing somewhat more to Rinvoq given new indications, but both grow.
- Succession planning: Criteria-based timing (post-LOE stability and strong performance). Process involves board approval; announcement would preface a 4–6 month transition with Rick Gonzalez likely as Executive Chair for a period.
- IRA/Part D:
  - Part D redesign (2025) modeled; higher plan liability a net headwind of a few points to growth, partially offset by lower abandonment via cap/smoothing.
  - Medicare drug negotiation included in long-term guide; initial CMS offer for Imbruvica received; final price by Sept 1, 2024.
- Ludicizumab (HS/IBD): Strong HS Ph2 in anti-TNF IR patients; safety (neutropenia) dose-driven and manageable; IBD rationale via IL-1β signature, HS/IBD overlap, and potential biomarker- and combo-based strategies.
- Elahere (ovarian): Strategy to move earlier (including sensitive disease), expand to medium expressors, and combine with carbo (full-dose feasible), bevacizumab, and PARPs; timelines imply later-decade readouts.
- Humira tail: US tail likely begins 2025–2026; more color after 2024 full-year biosimilar dynamics (volume/interchangeability/contracting). International declines moderating post-final wave markets; ongoing erosion largely standard price pressure and mix shift to Skyrizi/Rinvoq.
- ABBV-951 market: Establishes non-surgical, high-efficacy “transition zone” between complex device-aided therapies (DBS/Duopa) and failing high-burden orals; early Japan/EU uptake encouraging.
- Alzheimer’s: Multiple shots on goal across pathology and symptoms; potential differentiation in Aβ mAb (916) via SC dosing intervals/ARIA profile.
- Aesthetics recovery and GLP-1s: No measurable impact yet from obesity drugs; net long-term tailwind as patients become more appearance-engaged. 2024 U.S. toxin recovery stronger than fillers; China flat for 2024 with 2H improvement; strength in Japan/LatAm.
- Margins: Operating margin to expand in 2025 despite full-year deal dilution; multi-year steady expansion; peak around ~50%.
- M&A: After ImmunoGen/Cerevel, focus shifts to earlier-stage, smaller deals across core areas to drive growth in the 2030s.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward outlook:
  - 2024: Base growth resumes; strong growth drivers in immunology, neuro, migraines; aesthetics improving; oncology mixed with Imbruvica declines offset by Venclexta/Epkinly/Elahere contributions.
  - 2025–2029: Robust growth re-acceleration; high single-digit CAGR sustained; margin expansion resumes; several key pipeline/value inflections (Skyrizi UC, Rinvoq new indications, Teliso-V potential approval, 951 U.S., aesthetics innovation).
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Upward revision of Skyrizi/Rinvoq 2027 target to >$27B and CGRP peak >$3B.
  - Reaffirmed long-term high single-digit CAGR even after including deal dilution and IRA/Part D headwinds.
  - Strong ex-Humira platform growth (+15% in Q4) and aesthetics confidence despite China softness.

6) Takeaways
- Ex-Humira engine delivered: Q4 ex-Humira +15% with marquee brands (Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, CGRP) set for double-digit growth in 2024; aesthetics recovery underway in the U.S.
- Long-term raised where it matters: Skyrizi/Rinvoq targets boosted by >$6B for 2027; CGRP peak >$3B; still guiding to high single-digit CAGR through 2029 with margin expansion resuming in 2025 (toward ~50% peak).
- Strategic pipeline depth: Multiple near- and mid-term catalysts (Teliso-V, 951 U.S., Epkinly FL, Venclexta MDS, Skyrizi UC, Rinvoq 2nd-wave, ludicizumab HS/IBD, ADCs ABBV-400) plus Alzheimer’s optionality.
- Policy headwinds manageable: Part D redesign from 2025 and IRA negotiation modeled; near-term growth in 2025 tempered by a few points but robust trajectory intact.
- Risks/uncertainties: Humira U.S. tail shape (interchangeability/contracting), Imbruvica erosion, China aesthetics softness, oncology competitive dynamics, and execution/timing on accelerated approvals and late-stage readouts.
