  - Attrition metric: will include MuleSoft/Tableau starting FY24; expected slightly above 7.5%

3) Management Commentary
- Transformation to profitable growth accelerated:
  - Cost/structural actions: January headcount reduction; significant real estate consolidation; sales/success org reduced ~10% with further optimization planned
  - GTM overhaul: tighter performance culture, margin-aligned incentives, fewer layers, larger spans of control; in-office presence (min 4 days/week) for customer-facing teams to lift enablement and productivity
  - Product focus: prioritizing core innovation; deeper integration of MuleSoft, Tableau, Slack; bundling to raise ASPs; multi-cloud expansion; vertical solutions scaled
  - Data Cloud (Genie) singled out as strategic third-horizon platform; viewed as “intelligent heart” of Customer 360; Tableau+Data Cloud launched
  - AI roadmap: Einstein GPT to be unveiled at TrailheadDX; Slack highlighted as UI for generative AI (e.g., Anthropic)
  - External support: Bain engaged for comprehensive operating and GTM review
- Capital allocation/structure:
  - Share repurchase authorization doubled to $20B; $4B executed to date; plan to fully offset SBC dilution in FY24
  - SBC to trend below 9% of revenue in FY24 (from just over 10% in FY23), aided by roll-off of prior M&A equity and compensation program changes
  - Disbanded M&A committee; focus on integration over new deals
- Market position:
  - IDC #1 CRM for the 9th year; management asserts continued CRM share gains
  - Customer attrition at lowest level in company’s 24-year history

4) Q&A Highlights
- Growth and restructuring: Management confident GTM re-architecture and headcount actions will not impair growth; FY24 guide assumes no macro improvement; productivity (not AE hiring) becomes primary growth lever; bundling and multi-cloud selling to lift ASPs
- Q4 upside: Concentrated in MuleSoft/Tableau license revenue and modest FX upside vs plan
- Profitability roadmap: FY24 non-GAAP margin 27%; at least 30% in Q1 FY25; “no ceiling” to margin aspirations; more actions coming across Sales, Marketing, and G&A
- SBC/GAAP vs non-GAAP: SBC expected below 9% of revenue in FY24; compensation mix changes and M&A equity runoff to narrow GAAP/non-GAAP gap over time
- Demand signals: SMB, tech, and financial services weaker; strength in public sector, manufacturing/energy, travel/hospitality; Slack self-serve more impacted
- Strategic priorities: Data Cloud/CDP and vertical clouds central to pulling multiple components of the stack; 8 of 13 industry clouds grew >50% ARR; top deals increasingly multi-cloud (top 10 had 5+ clouds; top 5 had 7+)

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Demand: Assumes persistently measured environment; focus on navigating longer cycles and approvals
  - Cost: Continued structural cost discipline; real estate downsizing; productivity enablement; margin-friendly incentives
  - Growth engines: Data Cloud, AI (Einstein GPT), multi-cloud consolidation, vertical solutions, deeper integration of acquired assets
  - Capital returns: Accelerated buybacks to neutralize dilution
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Margin acceleration (27% FY24; ≥30% by Q1 FY25) pulled forward by two years vs prior FY26 25%+ target
  - Buyback doubled to $20B; disbanded M&A committee signals disciplined capital allocation
  - Strong MuleSoft/Tableau inclusion in top deals; Data Cloud highlighted as fastest-growing cloud

6) Takeaways
- Salesforce executed a sharp pivot to profitability, delivering record Q4 margins and guiding to 27% FY24 non-GAAP operating margin with a path to ≥30% by early FY25.
- Top-line remains resilient at double-digit growth despite a measured demand backdrop; Q4 outperformance tied to MuleSoft/Tableau license strength.
- Structural changes are broad-based: workforce and real estate reductions, GTM re-architecture, tighter performance culture, and margin-aligned incentives.
- Product focus is narrowing around Data Cloud and AI, deeper integration of MuleSoft/Tableau/Slack, and vertical solutions—fueling multi-cloud expansion and higher ASPs.
- Capital allocation is notably more shareholder-friendly: buyback doubled, SBC trending lower, M&A deprioritized; FY26 $50B revenue target not reiterated given macro/FX uncertainty.
