1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)
- Period: Fiscal Q3 2025 (12 weeks ended May 11, 2025)
- Macro/industry backdrop:
  - Evolving tariff environment creating cost and sourcing complexity; Costco actively mitigating via local sourcing, rerouting, and supplier collaboration.
  - Gasoline price deflation weighed on reported comps; FX headwinds on international translation.
  - Commodity deflation in several key inputs (butter, eggs, dairy, olive oil) after prior inflation, aiding fresh and food/sundries margins.
  - Supply chain broadly stable but shipping delivery dates remain less predictable vs. pre-COVID; spot container rates up recently, though Costco largely insulated by contracts.
  - Consumer still value-focused; Costco leaning into price investment and Kirkland Signature.

    - LIFO: $130M charge (vs. $11M credit last year), -23 bps impact.
  - SG&A rate: 9.16%, up 20 bps (+11 bps ex-gas), reflecting wage investments and a catch-up accrual for increased vacation days.
- Membership:
  - Fee income: $1.24B (+10.4% YoY; +11.4% ex-FX); recent fee increase ≈4.6% of fee income in the quarter.
  - Renewal rates: U.S./Canada 92.7%; Worldwide 90.2% (down vs. Q2 due to Groupon 2023 cohort and higher digital signups, which renew slightly lower; mix skews younger).
  - Paid households: 79.6M (+6.8%); Cardholders: 142.8M (+6.6%); Executive paid members: 37.6M (+9%), representing 47.3% of paid members and 73.1% of sales.

  - Net interest and other: $50M (vs. $87M last year), largely FX.
  - Tax rate: 26.2% (vs. 26.4%).
- Guidance/Outlook provided:
  - LIFO: If current inflation persists, Q4 incremental LIFO charge estimated at $40–50M (full-year ≈$145M; U.S. inventory only).
  - Capex: “A little over” $5B for FY25.
  - New units: FY25 plan for 27 openings (incl. 3 relocations), 24 net new; Q4 plan of 10 openings. Year-end warehouse count expected at 914 worldwide.
  - No formal sales/EPS/margin guidance (consistent with Costco’s practice).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and operations:
  - Continuing to “invest in price” and widen value gaps, supported by limited-SKU buying scale, local sourcing shifts, and Kirkland Signature penetration (+50 bps YoY).
  - Proactive tariff mitigation: pulled forward seasonal imports, rerouted high-tariff goods to non-U.S. markets, sourced more local/domestic alternatives, and worked with long-term suppliers on cost offsets.
  - Member experience initiatives: extended U.S. gas hours (two all-time highest gallon weeks), front-end technology pilots (digital wallet, digital membership, in-house Scan & Go tests) to speed checkout and improve parking turnover.
  - E-commerce and digital: BNPL via Affirm for big-ticket items; personalization campaigns and recommendation hub; Costco Logistics scaling big/bulky with installation/haul-away driving 31% delivery growth.
- Merchandising:
  - Fresh comps high single digits (meat double-digit; produce strong); Food & Sundries mid-to-high single digits (cooler/frozen strongest).
  - Non-foods high single digits, with double-digit growth in gold/jewelry, majors, toys, housewares, and home furnishings; some deceleration as Costco laps prior surges in bullion and gift cards.
  - Notable price reductions: eggs (~-10%), butter (~-7% per unit), KS 2L EVOO ($24.99 to $18.39), KS chocolate macadamia clusters, KS organic mixed nut butter.
  - Local sourcing examples: APAC laundry SKUs moved to local production cut member prices ~40%; U.S. sourcing increased in mattresses, pillows, plastic resin goods.
  - >40 new Kirkland Signature items launched in Q3.
- Store growth:
  - 9 warehouse openings in Q3 (incl. Melbourne relocation, 37th Japan, 7 net new U.S.); Q4 openings 80% targeted to cannibalize high-volume sites to relieve congestion.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Pricing posture: “Full force ahead” on price investments; improved competitive delta late in the quarter due to faster price cuts and commodity cost relief.
- Tariffs and demand timing: Pulled forward summer non-foods to preempt tariffs; slight, hard-to-quantify demand pull-forward. Six-to-eight-month buying commitments; nimble sourcing and inventory flows, including shifting goods across regions if needed.
- Margin cadence: While EBIT margin has improved YoY for many quarters, management optimizes long-term value, returning ~90% of savings to members while seeking modest margin expansion over time; no quarterly targets.
- LIFO mechanics: $130M Q3 reflects year-to-date true-up as non-food inflation turned positive; if current trends persist, Q4 adds $40–50M; full-year implies ~1–1.5% inflation on U.S. inventories ($12–13B base). No direct carryover into FY26 unless inflation persists/changes.
- Capacity/member experience: Opening clubs to relieve pressure at ~$400M+ sales units; checkout tech and extended gas hours improving throughput and parking turnover.
- Digital and logistics:
  - E-commerce penetration: ~8% by Costco’s definition; slightly >10% including categories others might include (e.g., travel/Instacart); ~12% if excluding gas from denominator.
  - Costco Logistics handles ~80–85% of big/bulky deliveries; ~20–25% of total deliveries.
  - Over half of members have downloaded the app; continued runway for digital engagement.
- Membership trends: Renewal rate fluctuations likely to persist due to digital mix and Asia openings; younger digital members renew slightly lower, but targeted engagement expected to improve retention. Minimal pushback to recent fee increase so far.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward demand/costs:
  - Consumer remains choiceful; strong response to quality, value, and newness—especially in big/bulky, health/beauty, and non-foods despite tougher laps.
  - Commodity relief aiding Fresh/F&S; returning low single-digit inflation in non-food imports tied to tariffs.
  - Tariff path uncertain; Costco expects to widen relative value via sourcing agility and limited-SKU scale.
- Capital allocation and growth:
  - Capex >$5B; ongoing investment in depots/logistics, e-commerce capabilities, front-end tech, and new units (with targeted cannibalization to enhance member experience).
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Strong gross margin expansion despite a sizable LIFO charge and higher wages.
  - E-commerce outperformance (+15–16% adj comps) and big/bulky logistics scaling.
  - Renewal rate dip explained by mix (Groupon 2023 cohort, digital signups), not by underlying member dissatisfaction.

6) Takeaways
- Costco delivered solid top-line and double-digit EPS growth, with margin expansion driven by Fresh/F&S leverage and e-commerce/gas margins, despite a $130M LIFO charge and wage investments.
- Tariffs are raising non-food costs modestly; management is actively mitigating through sourcing shifts, pull-forwards, and regional rerouting while continuing to invest in price to defend share.
- Membership fundamentals remain strong: fee income +10%+, paid households +7%, Executive penetration rising; renewal softness is mix-driven and management expects to improve digital cohort retention.
- Digital momentum continues: affirm BNPL launch, personalization, and logistics scale drove e-commerce comps mid-teens and big/bulky growth; front-end tech pilots aim to relieve congestion and speed checkout.
- Network growth is balanced with experience: new clubs (80% cannibalizing high-volume sites in Q4) and operational/tech enhancements target throughput, parking turnover, and overall member experience.

7) Other Notable Information
