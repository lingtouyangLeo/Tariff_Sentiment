Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives/product
  - Coach (record revenue >$5B; “Expressive Luxury”): Tabby family nearly doubled; expanded (Tabby Backpack). Testing full-price Tabby 26 in >100 outlet stores globally (selling at full price) – exceeding plan; to scale across channels. New platforms: Juliet shoulder bag; “New York” family incl. Brooklyn bag; lifestyle expansion (footwear: low-line sneaker, Bryn sandal; RTW: leather jackets; men’s: League family).
  - Marketing: “Courage to be Real” and “Find Your Courage”; immersive retail; gaming collabs (Roblox, Zepeto). ~4.2M new NA Coach customers in FY (1M in 4Q; ~60% Gen Z/Millennials).
  - Kate Spade: Focus on core handbag innovation and brand codes (Grace, Phoebe, Spadeflower); amplify with holistic brand-building. Lifestyle growth led by jewelry; first dedicated jewelry store in London (test). Launched katespadeoutlet.com (replaced Surprise site); outlet digital up with higher margins. ~2.3M new NA customers in FY (500k in 4Q).
  - Stuart Weitzman: Pivot to sophisticated casual (incl. flats); expand men’s and handbags. NA wholesale POS up double digits in 4Q; bookings through Spring ’25 +30% YoY; expect revenue and profit improvement.
- Risks/challenges
  - China macro softness; NA consumer choicefulness; Capri standalone performance deteriorated.
  - FX and freight tailwinds moderating; cautious on H1 FY25.
- Competitive landscape
  - Coach gaining share in handbags with AUR momentum; ranked on Lyst for hottest brands/products.

Q&A Highlights
- Capri acquisition
  - Commitment reaffirmed; strategic fit intact despite Capri underperformance (surprising, esp. profit/cash flow). Michael Kors still operates at high-teens operating margin.
  - Synergies: initial “>$200M” now with increased conviction; potential upside; details to come at close.
  - Financials: Expect adjusted EPS accretion in year one, double-digit ROIC, deleverage to <2.5x within 24 months post-close; maintain investment grade.
  - Plan B if deal fails: FCF baseline ~$1.2B; after ~$325M dividends, >$800M excess annual cash for deployment; buybacks compelling at current valuation.
- Coach brand health & margins
  - NA: slight growth in 4Q at “incredible” brand-level gross margins (~76%, ~600 bps above FY19 per brand commentary). 4Q margin compression vs prior year due to timing of marketing spend (no trend change). Structural GM drivers intact: AUR and AUC (supply chain efficiencies).
  - AUR: Global handbag AUR flat cc in 4Q (mix), NA AUR positive; continued innovation and brand heat support AUR.
  - Channel strategy: “Blur the lines” – place select full-price icons (Tabby, Brooklyn) in outlet at full price to meet demand; strategy already successful in China; scaling globally.
- Kate Spade
  - Will continue to invest in top/mid-funnel while expanding margins; aim to reaccelerate top-line growth.
- China
  - FY25 planned roughly in line with FY24; long-term bullish. Coach positioned to capture mid-market luxury demand (value vs European luxury); expansion in Tier 2/3 cities.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand/mix:
  - FY25 growth led by Europe (mid-teens) and Other Asia (mid-single-digit); North America, Japan, Greater China ~flat.
  - China expected to improve in 2H on easier comps; cautious H1.
- Cost outlook:
  - Freight negligible impact for FY25 (slight tailwind H1; slight headwind H2); ongoing AUC efficiencies; FX a modest headwind for the year.
- Capital allocation:
  - Priorities unchanged: invest in brands, rapid deleveraging post-Capri, maintain/increase dividend over time; resume buybacks after deleveraging (or sooner if Plan B).
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - 4Q EPS beat; gross margin strongest 4Q in 15+ years; synergy confidence increased despite Capri weakness; guidance prudent (low top-line, margin expansion, mid-single-digit EPS growth).

Takeaways
- Coach momentum remains the core engine: record revenue, strong brand heat with younger consumers, and structural gross margin tailwinds (AUR/AUC), with innovative channel strategy (full-price icons in outlet) to broaden reach.
- FY25 guidance is conservative on revenue but calls for continued margin expansion and strong cash generation; cost levers and discipline underpin EPS growth.
- China is near-term cautious but long-term opportunity remains compelling; Europe and Other Asia drive growth.
- Capri deal still strategic and financially attractive; synergy outlook improving; deleveraging plan intact. If not consummated, Tapestry has ample FCF to pursue buybacks and reinvest.
- Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman: margin progress and groundwork laid; FY25 focus is reigniting top-line (Kate via brand building; SW via wholesale momentum and bookings).
