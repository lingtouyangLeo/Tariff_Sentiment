  - Platform momentum: iOS 26, macOS 26, iPadOS 26 are Apple’s most popular developer betas to date; new cross-platform design “liquid glass.”
  - Hardware highlights: iPhone 16 family leading upgrades; M4 MacBook Air performance; Vision Pro advances (VisionOS 26 spatial widgets, lifelike personas, enterprise APIs).
  - Services: broad-based strength; App Store double-digit growth and record; Apple TV+ engagement (81 Emmy nominations; film F1); Apple Music 10-year initiatives; cloud services record on iCloud paying accounts growth; “well over a billion” paid subscriptions across services.
  - Enterprise traction: record June quarter for Mac in enterprise; examples include PayPal, Roche, Siam Commercial Bank (iPad), CAE (Vision Pro training).
- Supply chain and tariffs:
  - June-quarter tariff costs ~$800M; Sep-quarter estimate ~$1.1B (volumes and prior build-ahead timing factors).
  - Country of origin (US market): majority of iPhones from India; vast majority of Macs/iPad/Watch from Vietnam; most international supply remains China.
  - US investment: $500B over four years planned; chips across 12 states/24 factories; MP Materials recycled rare earths; Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit.
- CapEx:
  - Moving higher, significantly driven by AI (first-party data centers/private cloud compute); hybrid infrastructure strategy using both Apple and third party. Growth substantial but not “exponential.”

4) Q&A Highlights
- Upgrade strength:
  - Records in iPhone, Mac, Watch driven by product strength (iPhone 16 lineup; Apple Silicon performance). Estimated tariff-related pull-forward contributed ~1 point of company growth in April (of the 10% total growth).
- Guidance bridge:
  - Mid-high single-digit Sep growth reflects: (1) Q3 tariff pull-forward (~1 pt) and (2) tough iPad compare (full prior-year iPad launch impact in Sep quarter last year). FX a minor tailwind.
- China:
  - Sequential growth; iPhone acceleration; Mac strong; record install base; top models in urban China; subsidies in place (tailwind); majority of buyers for Mac/iPad/Watch new to product.
- Services/search dynamics:
  - Services +13% dispelled concerns; App Store US double-digit growth despite Epic-related changes implemented late in the quarter. Management monitoring evolving consumer search behavior; Apple devices remain valuable access points.
- CapEx/AI:
  - CapEx rising primarily due to AI; hybrid compute model; more investment planned in Sep quarter as well.
- Tariffs:
  - Costs scale with volume and subject to rate changes; caution against extrapolating to December due to possible rate changes and volume seasonality.
- Channel inventory:
  - iPhone channel inventory reduced during the quarter; ended near low end of target range.
- Device form factors and AI:
  - Management expects new devices to be complementary, not substitutes for iPhone; sees AI profoundly enhancing all devices.
- M&A:
  - ~7 acquisitions YTD (small); open to larger deals that accelerate roadmap, especially around AI.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward commentary:
  - Confident on AI roadmap (personalized Siri next year), expanding investments, developer momentum.
  - Services outlook steady at ~13% growth into Sep; continued strong engagement and subscription expansion.
  - Tariffs disclosed with specificity; supply chain diversification progressing; increasing US-based investments.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Stronger-than-typical June quarter seasonality for iPhone and Mac; Services at 13% growth despite market worries about search and App Store changes.
  - Clear tariff quantification and guidance inclusion; CapEx rising but framed as substantial, not exponential.

6) Takeaways
- Broad beat and records: Revenue and EPS set June-quarter records; strength across iPhone, Mac, and Services; Services all-time high with diversified momentum.
- AI is the growth engine: Significant step-up in AI investments (on-device + private cloud compute), robust developer interest, and personalized Siri targeted for next year.
- Tariffs are a real cost headwind: ~$800M in Q3, ~$1.1B estimated in Q4; mitigation via supply chain optimization and large-scale US investments, but outlook remains uncertain given policy risk.
- Guidance steady but prudent: Sep quarter mid-to-high single-digit growth reflects pull-forward normalization and tough iPad compare; Services growth sustained; GM resilient despite tariffs.
- China stabilizing: Sequential growth with product momentum and subsidies; record install base; leadership positions in key categories, but sustainability will be watched.
