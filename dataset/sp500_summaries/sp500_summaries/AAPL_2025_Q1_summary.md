  - Apple Intelligence rollout expanded in Dec (U.S. English plus additional English-speaking markets). Broader language expansion in April (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese; localized English for Singapore/India). More features and a more capable Siri coming “over the next several months.”
  - iPhone 16/16 Pro: A18-powered, larger Pro displays, camera control, battery life; Apple Intelligence cited as a key demand driver.
  - Mac: Strong uptake across M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini; positioning Mac as leading AI PC platform due to Apple Silicon and Neural Engine.
  - iPad: Growth led by iPad Air and entry iPad; over half of buyers new to iPad.
  - Wearables: Watch Series 10 with new health features; hearing health on AirPods Pro 2; Vision Pro expanding geographically with growing enterprise and creative use cases.
  - Services: Broad-based growth; Apple TV+ slate momentum; Find My/AirTag airline integration; Tap to Pay in 20 markets; >1B paid subscriptions.
- Risks/Challenges:
  - Greater China revenue -11% YoY; over half of decline due to channel inventory reduction; intense competition; AI features not yet launched in China.
  - FX headwinds expected to persist into March quarter.
  - Regulatory environment for services remains complex; Apple emphasized breadth, engagement, and subscriptions growth.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Apple Intelligence impact:
  - Markets with Apple Intelligence showed stronger iPhone 16 YoY performance than those without; iPhone 16 family outperforming iPhone 15 since launch; all-time record for upgraders.
  - Adoption expected to accelerate with device eligibility growth and April language rollout; Siri upgrades seen as a frequent-use driver.
- China:
  - Decline partly due to channel inventory reductions; ending inventory “leaner than expected.” National subsidies (post-quarter) could help across categories; more color next quarter.
- Margins:
  - March GM guide strong; FX a headwind, offset by favorable costs and services mix; Q1 benefited from mix (Pro skew, services), leverage, and commodity tailwinds.
  - Services GM at 75% supported by broad momentum and scale businesses (payments, iCloud); margin profile varies across service lines.
- Demand/Products:
  - Significant runway for smartphone innovation; management “could not feel more optimistic” about product pipeline.
  - Mac/iPad growth sustainability tied to compelling M4 products and AI workloads; double-digit growth in both upgraders and new-to-Mac; iPad growth driven by Air/entry models.
- Emerging markets:
  - Strong install base growth; India highlighted (record quarter, iPhone top-selling model, store expansion). Manufacturing in India serves both domestic and export needs.
- Pricing/Capex:
  - Discipline on pricing to continue; hybrid compute model (on-device + private cloud) and prudent CapEx.
- Tariffs/regulatory:
  - Monitoring potential tariff impacts; services continues to grow broadly despite regulatory burdens.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking:
  - Confidence in Apple Intelligence as a multiyear demand catalyst across devices; language expansion in Q3 (Apr) should broaden adoption.
  - Services growth trajectory intact; >1B paid subs, rising engagement.
  - Margin resilience expected to continue within guided range despite FX.
  - China cautious but potential support from national subsidies; AI rollout pending there.
  - Capital returns ongoing; program update expected with March quarter results.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Stronger-than-expected Mac and iPad growth; services outperformance and record GM likely positive.
  - iPhone flat YoY and China -11% are watch items; China decline mitigated by channel inventory dynamics.

6) Takeaways
- Record quarter driven by services strength and double-digit Mac/iPad growth; iPhone stable; margins at elevated levels with favorable mix.
- Apple Intelligence is beginning to lift demand where available; broader language rollout and Siri enhancements could amplify impact in coming quarters.
- China remains a headwind, but more than half of the decline was channel inventory; upcoming national subsidies and future AI rollout represent potential tailwinds.
- Services engine robust (breadth, engagement, >1B paid subs) with 75% GM; remains a key margin and cash flow driver.
- Guidance implies continued growth and strong margins despite FX; emerging markets, especially India, provide multi-year runway; management confident in innovation pipeline and capital return discipline.
