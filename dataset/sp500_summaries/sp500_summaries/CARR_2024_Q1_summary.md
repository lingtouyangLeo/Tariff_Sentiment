  - VCS 2024 sales now flat to -5% (Q2 similar to Q1; seasonal lift in 2H). Q1 down ~12% (more than half from lower solar PV—lower margin).
  - Heat pumps expected up mid-single digits; boilers down low double digits; solar PV down >30% for 2024; aftermarket +mid-teens.
  - Aggressive cost actions underway (materials, logistics, VE, insourcing) beyond defined “synergies.”
- Data centers:
  - Backlog doubled in Q1, further key wins in April; DCs currently low double-digit % of applied HVAC, targeted to >20% of commercial HVAC over “next few years.”
  - Investing in capacity (including Mexico) and liquid cooling (VC investment in Strategic Thermal Labs).
- Digital/aftermarket:
  - Buildings: >1.2B sq ft monitored on Abound (+10% QoQ).
  - Homes: Viessmann OneBase integrates HVAC, water heating, solar PV, battery storage, grid interface; IntelliSense predictive service capabilities.
  - Cold chain: Lynx subscriptions +50% YoY; ~130k subscriptions; new energy-efficient reefer/container units.
  - Aftermarket: +6% in Q1; double-digit commercial HVAC; targets $7B aftermarket by 2026 now requires low double-digit CAGR due to portfolio changes; 75k chillers under LTAs (35k connected); attachment rate 48%; ~5k new chiller connections in Q1 (post-spin high).
- A2L transition (R-454B):
  - Price uplift 15–20% over two years reaffirmed (low double-digit 454B vs. 410A differential plus base price).
  - 2024 mix < prior 20% expectation; some 410A pre-buy likely; 2025 mix likely >60% (possibly ~70%).
  - Early shipments begun; dealer training extensive.

4) Q&A Highlights
- VCS trajectory: Q2 sales similar to Q1; 2H pickup expected; FY flat to -5%. Heat pumps up MSD; boilers down LDD; solar PV down >30%.
- HVAC margins: FY HVAC margin ~17.5% (+~100 bps YoY); Q2 and Q3 up ~100 bps YoY; Q4 also better YoY.
- PFAS/legal: Chapter 11 for KFI proceeding as expected; mediation progressing; JCI settlement (water claims only) noted; overall progress supports sale process for R&CF.
- R&CF sale: Prioritizing a sale (not ruling out public exit); strong buyer interest; business ~ $2B revenue with run-rate EBITDA mid-$200Ms and improving.
- CEO commitment: Dave Gitlin removed himself from Boeing CEO consideration; “100% committed to Carrier.”
- Data centers: US share currently low; capacity is the gating factor (not technology); “exponential” growth; dedicated tiger team; global wins in water- and air-cooled chillers; liquid cooling strategy in place.
- Productivity/pricing: Q1 price ~2% (FY ~2%); price+net productivity ~$200M in Q1, ~$600M for FY; copper headwind partly hedged (~50%); steel/aluminum offset; logistics tailwind; overhead reductions and factory productivity back to positive.
- Light commercial: Orders down on tough comp/lead times; FY sales outlook improving vs. prior “down mid-single digits”; verticals (K-12, value retail, healthcare/urgent care, QSR) remain strong.
- Europe resi destocking: Largely behind given direct-to-installer model; expect order pick-up starting May/June as incentives clarified; heating season to drive 2H.
- Competition in EU heat pumps: Viessmann positioned at premium tier; multi-brand/multi-tier strategy (Viessmann premium; Carrier mid-tier; Toshiba) mitigates entry-level price competition risk.
- 2025 framework: Expect core EPS to grow double digits, plus additional levers from proceeds deployment (debt reduction, buybacks) and 2024/2025 FCF-funded repurchases; target ~100% FCF conversion of net income.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident execution; clear-eyed on near-term EMEA resi headwinds and NA T&T softness; strong conviction in DC cooling, A2L transition pricing, productivity, and VCS synergies.
- Capital allocation: Buybacks to resume in 2H’24 (not in guide); more material EPS impact in 2025.
- Surprises vs. expectations: Q1 upside driven by stronger productivity and some timing (tax); margin guidance raised; EPS held despite earlier Industrial Fire exit; DC backlog strength; VCS sales trimmed but minimal EPS impact due to productivity/mix/synergies.

6) Takeaways
- Strong Q1 beat and guidance quality: Margin raised to ~15.5%; EPS held at $2.85 despite earlier exit timing and lower VCS sales; core execution solid.
- Data center secular tailwind: Backlog doubled; multi-year runway with capacity expansion and liquid cooling investments to grow DC from low double-digit to >20% of commercial HVAC.
- VCS integration on track: Cost synergies pacing ($75M in 2024; >$200M by Y3); revenue synergies likely significant; near-term sales softer (solar PV down), but EPS impact modest.
- A2L transition as pricing lever: 15–20% price over two years reaffirmed; pre-buy dynamics manageable; early mover advantage in product and dealer readiness.
- Portfolio simplification unlocking capital: Three exits contracted; R&CF sale targeted by year-end; deleveraging to ~2x; buybacks resume in 2H’24; multiple EPS growth levers for 2025.
