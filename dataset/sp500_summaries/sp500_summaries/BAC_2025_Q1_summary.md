  - Credit posture and balance sheet substantially de-risked vs pre-GFC and pre-pandemic; diversified by product and geography; high-quality, collateralized consumer book
  - Reserves modeled using Blue Chip consensus with overlays; overall reserve positioning implies ~6% unemployment scenario; card reserve ~7.4%
- Industry/regulatory:
  - Expectation of regulatory recalibration (e.g., SLR treatment of Treasuries/cash, operational burden) and potential GSIB framework indexing; management aiming to “grow into” capital while maintaining flexibility

4) Q&A Highlights
- Capital management/buybacks:
  - CET1 cushion remains ample; Q1 buyback stepped to $4.5B; scope to increase over time while funding RWA for markets and loan growth; no fixed CET1 target disclosed
- NII/NIM trajectory and rates:
  - Q4’25 NII exit unchanged despite curve now embedding four 2025 cuts (later-timed cuts temper 2025 impact, more felt in 2026); target medium-term NIM 2.3% still intact over next couple of years
  - Asset sensitivity (vs April 10 forward): -100 bps instantaneous move would lower 12-month NII by ~$2.2B; +100 bps would add ~$1.0B
  - Fixed-rate repricing tailwinds: HTM roll-offs ~$8–9B/qtr at >200 bps pickup; mortgage originations ~$4–5B/qtr at >200 bps pickup; cash-flow swap roll-down benefits ~150 bps pick-up phased in 2H
- Deposits/pricing:
  - Passing through rate declines across commercial/wealth; continued measured pricing in consumer (0.61% rate paid on ~$950B deposits); overall rate paid fell 15 bps QoQ to 1.79%
- Credit:
  - Card NCOs normalized around ~4% vs post-pandemic lows; delinquency improving; commercial losses modest and diversified; CRE office remained a drag in prior periods but contained
- Markets/IB:
  - April volatility boosted client activity; environment “constructive”; firm-wide IB pipeline healthy but clients waiting on policy clarity
- Growth drivers:
  - Loan growth aided by expanded banker coverage domestically and abroad and AI-directed calling; small business cautious on investment timing amid policy shifts but current conditions solid

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on core fundamentals and organic growth; candid on macro/policy uncertainty and timing effects
- Demand trends: Consumer spending steady; small business demand cautious pending clarity; modest uptick in revolver utilization
- Cost outlook: Expense discipline intact; regulatory/operational burden expected to ease over time
- Capital allocation: Will continue repurchases while funding business growth; flexibility remains; dividend stable
- Surprise vs expectations: NII at high end of prior range; better-than-expected deposit growth and lower deposit costs; strong S&T; gains on leveraged finance disposals; litigation expense higher

6) Takeaways
- Core momentum resilient: Revenue +6% YoY, EPS +18%, operating leverage positive; broad-based growth across consumer, wealth, commercial, and markets.
- NII story intact: Q4’25 exit unchanged at $15.5–$15.7B; multiple repricing levers offset timing of rate cuts; full-year NII +6–7%.
- Balance sheet strength: CET1 11.8%, SLR 5.7%, nearly $1T liquidity; deposit costs declining; share count down ~4% YoY.
- Credit stable and well-reserved: NCOs flat at 0.54%; delinquencies improved; reserves aligned to ~6% unemployment; consumer book high quality (avg FICO ~770s; low LTVs).
- Macro/policy uncertainty is the wild card: Clients delaying some decisions (IB, capex) pending clarity on tariffs/regulation/taxes; management prepared for varied outcomes.
