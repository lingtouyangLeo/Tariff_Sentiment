Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)
- Period: Fiscal Q2 2025 (12 weeks ended February 16, 2025). February sales (4 weeks ended March 2) also provided.
- Macro/industry context:
  - Consumer remains willing to spend but increasingly choiceful; ongoing mix shift toward food at home vs. away-from-home.
  - Inflation low single digits overall with an uptick in quarter (fresh/meat most inflationary; non-foods recently deflationary but normalizing).
  - FX a material headwind to reported international results; supply chain stable but shipping less predictable than pre-COVID.
  - Tariff risk elevated and fluid; company planning to mitigate through sourcing agility and buying power.
  - Gas prices roughly flat YoY in February; extended gas station hours to capture commuter demand.

Management Commentary
- Growth/expansion:
  - 900th Costco opening (Sharon, MA on March 12); extended gas station hours across North America; 60 U.S. gas station expansions underway.
  - International expansion remains a key growth pillar; roughly half of future openings expected outside U.S.
- Labor and culture:
  - New employee agreement in U.S./Canada: top-of-scale +$1/hr now, +$1 in March 2026 and March 2027; U.S. service clerk top of scale now $31.90/hr; minimum $20/hr; average wage a little >$31/hr including hourly bonuses. Paid vacation now starts in year one; 6-week vacation after 30 years.
- Merchandising/price investment:
  - Non-food comps mid-teens; strong holiday sales in large-screen TVs, gaming, jewelry, gift cards, toys, housewares, appliances, sporting goods, small electrics.
  - Fresh up high single digits (double-digit meat; stronger unit growth in lower-cost proteins).
  - Food & sundries low-to-mid single-digit comps; examples of price reductions (e.g., KS olive oil, organic peanut butter, tortilla strips).
  - Localized sourcing to reduce costs (e.g., in-country produced KS water in China at >20% savings).
  - KS innovation: upgraded diapers with quality improvements and ~11% better value; new KS fries, vodka+soda, lager.
  - Ancillary: pharmacy and food court led; new strawberry-banana smoothie; turkey provolone sandwich returning in Q3.
- Digital/e-commerce and alternative revenue:
  - App warehouse availability/pricing tool had 43M visits.
  - First targeted, personalized versions of digital multi-vendor mailer (MVM) launched in Q2; digital MVM is incremental to mailed MVM; ~40M recipients; improved engagement and traffic.
  - E-commerce strength aided by bullion; Costco Logistics delivered 500k+ big/bulky orders in holiday; Costco Next approaching 100 vendor sites with rising AOV.
  - Co-brand card enhancements: Executive members can effectively double cashback on most Costco purchases (to 4% total); 5% reward on Costco gas.
  - Retail media in early innings; ~10 off-site campaigns live; strategy is to reinvest value into member experience rather than position as a standalone profit pool.

Q&A Highlights
- Consumer/traffic:
  - Member spending steady but selective; continued tilt toward at-home food. Canada remained strong on a constant currency basis.
- Margins:
  - Core-on-core down 8 bps not seen as trend break; supply chain investment to carry higher inventory (hedge vs. timing unpredictability and potential tariffs).
- Tariffs/inflation:
  - Approach will mix passing through where necessary (esp. commodity/fresh) with sourcing shifts and cost mitigation; treasure-hunt model and limited SKU count enable nimble substitutions; about one-third of U.S. sales are imports; less than half of those from China, Mexico, Canada.
- Weather:
  - February storms modest headwind but largely recaptured outside holiday windows.
- International:
  - February “other international” sequential decel reflects Chinese New Year timing; long-runway internationally; profitability rates at or above U.S. in many markets.
- Category color:
  - Consumer electronics sluggish overall (Costco likely gaining share; larger TVs a holiday bright spot); non-foods broadly strong; bakery inflation driven by eggs despite deflation in sugar/butter/flour.
- Wages and productivity:
  - Wage headwinds to be offset by ongoing productivity and throughput initiatives; scanning at entry improved labor planning; exploring further tech/self-checkout enhancements; store-hour extensions under consideration (no changes yet).
- Gas:
  - February gallons down; YTD gallons up low single digits; extended gas hours driving incremental usage.
- Membership:
  - Renewal rates: U.S./Canada 93%, worldwide 90.5%. Paid households 78.4M (+6.8% YoY); cardholders 140.6M (+6.6%). Executive members 36.9M (+9.1%), now 47.1% of paid members and 73.8% of sales.
  - Fee increases: U.S./Canada already raised; Australia (FY23), Mexico (Sept 2024), and now Japan/Korea also increased. Executive program expansion continues as markets scale.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward demand: Strong traffic, improving basket size with non-food recovery; members prioritizing value/quality/newness; ongoing shift to at-home food.
- Cost outlook: Inflation trending up from flat to low single digits (meat/bakery most inflationary); potential tariffs a swing factor; wage headwind quantified; lower interest income persists vs. last year due to rates.
- Capital allocation/expansion: ~$5B CapEx; ~25 net new warehouses FY25; gas station capacity expansion; tech and logistics investments; retail media and personalization build-out; co-brand card richer rewards.
- Surprise elements: Outsized e-commerce growth; non-food mid-teens comp strength; early personalization traction; FX translation impact larger; membership fee benefit timing weighted to late FY25/early FY26.

Takeaways
- Traffic-led growth remains robust; non-foods re-accelerated and e-commerce up >20%, supporting strong top line despite FX and category headwinds.
- Margin discipline intact: modest GM and SG&A leverage while investing in price, supply chain inventory, and labor; wage headwinds manageable via productivity.
- Membership engine strong: fee income growth to accelerate over next 4 quarters; renewal rates and Executive penetration continue to climb; international fee hikes progressing.
- External risks rising: FX headwinds, potential tariffs, and normalized/slightly rising inflation could pressure mix and pricing; Costco’s sourcing agility and value positioning mitigate.
- Strategic execution advancing: accelerated openings, gas hour extensions, checkout throughput initiatives, personalization, and alternative revenue build-out support multi-year growth.
