Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Salesforce (ticker: CRM)
- Period: Fiscal Q2 2026
- Context: Management frames this as the onset of the “agentic enterprise” era—AI agents embedded across workflows powered by Salesforce Data Cloud. Macro demand mixed: strength in US and parts of EMEA (Netherlands, Switzerland); more measured in UK and Japan. Industry demand strong in Technology, Communications and Media; more measured in Retail/Consumer Goods and Public Sector (despite notable wins).

Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: $10.24–$10.25 billion, up 10% YoY (9% in constant currency); upside aided by one-time licensed revenue and professional services recognition plus strong execution.
- Margins: Q2 non-GAAP operating margin 34.3% (+60 bps YoY); GAAP operating margin up 370 bps YoY. 10th consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion.
- CRPO: $29.4 billion, up 11% YoY (10% cc), better than expected.
- AI & Data ARR: $1.2 billion, up 120% YoY.
- Large Deals/Bookings: Net new bookings from $1M+ deals up 26% YoY; 70% of top 100 wins included 5+ clouds; Service and Platform were in all top 10 wins; Data & AI in 60 deals >$1M.
- Guidance:
  - FY26 revenue: raised low end; $41.1–$41.3B (8.5–9% YoY; 8% cc). FX tailwind now ~$300M (up $50M).
  - FY26 non-GAAP op margin: raised to 34.1%; GAAP op margin 21.2% (includes restructuring).
  - FY26 operating cash flow growth: raised to 12–13% (cash tax savings from new tax bill); free cash flow growth 12–13%; CapEx slightly below 2% of revenue.
  - Q3 revenue: $10.24–$10.29B (8–9% YoY; 8% cc). Q3 CRPO growth: slightly above 10% nominal (~9% cc).
  - Note: CRPO growth will remain affected by “measured” sales performance since Q2 FY23.
- Cash Flow: Expect nearly $15B in FY26 operating cash flow.

Management Commentary
- Strategy and Product:
  - “Agentic enterprise” vision: Agents embedded across Sales, Service, Field Service, Marketing, Commerce, Tableau, and Slack; AgentForce adoption accelerating.
  - Data Cloud positioned as core “AI foundation” alongside MuleSoft and (pending) Informatica to unify, clean, and operationalize data for high-accuracy agents.
  - New products/launches: Agent-first, Slack-first IT Service Management (ITSM) platform launching at Dreamforce; AgentForce Version 4; certifications for government (FedRAMP High noted).
  - Consumption model: FlexCredits and pay-as-you-go options to lower adoption barriers; 80% of AgentForce Q2 new bookings via FlexCredits.
- Adoption metrics and customer proof points:
  - AgentForce: >6,000 paid deals; >12,500 overall. 60% QoQ increase in customers moving from pilot to production; 40% of AgentForce new bookings from existing customers.
  - Data Cloud: Customers +140% YoY; zero-copy “rows accessed” +326% YoY; now used by over half of the Fortune 500; described as a ~$7B business within Salesforce.
  - Examples: DirecTV (50k agent actions/week; ~300 hours saved), Under Armour (case deflection doubled; CSAT up double digits in <60 days), Reddit (avg resolution time cut from 8.9 to 1.4 minutes), Telepass (275k agent conversations in five months), FedEx (unified data; double-digit uplift in contract-to-shipping conversion).
- Public Sector: U.S. Army “fast pass” agreement; expanding into DoD with AgentForce for Public Sector and FedRAMP High certification.
- Capital allocation: Balanced “trinity”—buybacks, dividends, and disciplined M&A. Closed Convergence AI, Bluebirds, and Y; definitive agreement to acquire Regrello (agentic supply chain capabilities). Informatica expected to close Q4 FY26 or early FY27; not in guidance.

Q&A Highlights
- SaaS durability vs AI-native disruption: Management asserts AI is extending—not replacing—SaaS. The winning formula is deterministic workflows (core apps) + trusted data (Data Cloud) + agentic reasoning/actioning (AgentForce) on a unified metadata platform.
- Pilot-to-production acceleration: Product work to improve determinism, observability (AgentForce Command Center), UI/branding controls, and deeper integration with Data Cloud/MuleSoft reduced “pilot purgatory” and sped time-to-value.
- Mid-market opportunity: Stronger momentum in SMB and mid-market; Salesforce acts as “software hyperscaler” for firms lacking CIO/CTO depth. AE capacity up ~20% YoY; faster ramp in lower segments; “create-and-close” cycles accelerating.
- Capital returns vs M&A: Added $20B to buyback authorization; still pursuing strategic, agentic-focused M&A (e.g., Regrello) and larger Informatica deal; continuing dividends.
- Organizational change: Management stressed that becoming an agentic enterprise requires both technology and org design; internal restructuring includes redeployments and performance management alongside agent-driven operating changes.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand: Pipeline into H2 growing high teens; big-deal pipeline near 20% growth. Expect continued bookings strength as AgentForce/Data Cloud customers “refill the tank.”
- Cost outlook: Management targets long-term margin expansion via agent-first operations; internal deployments showing support productivity gains and case deflection at scale.
- Capital allocation: Significant authorization increase for buybacks plus ongoing dividend supports shareholder return narrative alongside selective M&A.
- Surprises vs expectations: Revenue, CRPO, and margins beat; FY26 guidance raised (revenue low end, margin, and cash flow). Note that part of revenue upside reflected one-time items.

Takeaways
- Salesforce is leaning into an “agent-first, data-first” platform strategy; AgentForce and Data Cloud are scaling quickly (AI & Data ARR +120% YoY to $1.2B).
- Q2 outperformed on revenue, CRPO, and margins; FY26 guidance raised with OCF now near $15B and margin expansion continuing.
- Early AI monetization traction: 80% of AgentForce new bookings via FlexCredits; 40% of bookings from existing customers; pilot-to-production conversions accelerating due to product hardening.
- Demand strength is broadening in SMB/mid-market and in large deals; pipeline growth is improving, but Marketing/Commerce remain weaker and public sector demand is measured.
- Capital returns stepped up with a $20B buyback authorization increase while maintaining capacity for strategic M&A (e.g., Regrello; Informatica pending).

Other Notable Information
- Dreamforce (Oct 14–16, San Francisco): Broad agentic product releases (including Slack-first ITSM, AgentForce v4, Marketing Cloud Next, Tableau Next, Voice), and extensive customer showcases (e.g., Dell, FedEx, Accenture, Williams-Sonoma, Pfizer).
- Government certifications: AgentForce and Data Cloud certified for government (FedRAMP High referenced), expanding public sector addressability.
- Restructuring: GAAP margin guidance includes additional restructuring charges as the company reorients to an agentic operating model.
- FX: FY26 FX tailwind now ~$300M.
- Shareholder returns: $2.6B returned in Q2 (buybacks + dividends); ~$27B cumulative since program inception; buyback authorization increased by $20B.
