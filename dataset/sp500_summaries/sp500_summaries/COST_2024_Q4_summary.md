*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)
- Period: Fiscal 4Q24 (16 weeks ended September 1, 2024); prior-year quarter was 17 weeks
- Macro/industry context:
  - Inflation broadly flat; slight inflation in fresh and food & sundries, deflation in non-foods
  - More promotional tone in appliances and consumer electronics
  - Supply chain largely stable; lingering Red Sea-related delays; monitoring potential port strike risk
  - Commodity mix: corn/flour/sugar deflation; butter/cocoa/eggs/cheese inflation; egg supply impacted by avian influenza
  - Gasoline prices ~5% lower YoY (mild headwind to reported ticket)

  - Renewal rates: U.S./Canada 92.9% (down 10 bps due to prior digital promo cohort); Worldwide 90.5% (flat QoQ)
  - Paid households: 76.2M (+7.3%); Cardholders: 136.8M (+7.0%); ~50% of FY24 new signups under age 40
  - Executive members: 35.4M (+9.6%); 46.5% of paid members; 73.5% of sales
- Margins/expenses
  - Gross margin: 11.0%, +40 bps YoY (+33 bps ex-gas). Drivers: gas and e-commerce in ancillary; core-on-core +9 bps; 2% rewards +4 bps; LIFO +5 bps
  - SG&A rate: 9.04%, +8 bps YoY (+2 bps ex-gas); wage increases in last 6 weeks were ~4 bps headwind
- Below-the-line
  - Interest expense $49M (vs $56M); interest income $138M (vs $201M) due to January 2024 $6.7B special dividend; lower interest income expected to be a 1H FY25 headwind
  - Effective tax rate 24.4% (26.4% ex-discrete item)
- Capex/new units
  - Capex: $1.58B in 4Q; $4.71B for FY24
  - Openings: 14 in 4Q (10 U.S., 2 Japan, 1 Korea, 1 China); FY24 achieved 30 openings (29 net)
  - FY25 plan: 29 planned openings (12 international), 3 relocations; 26 net new
- Guidance/cadence (qualitative)
  - No formal guidance; membership fee increase effective 9/1—benefit largely in 2H FY25 and into FY26 due to deferrals
  - 1H FY25 headwinds: lower interest income; Q1 gas profit comp tough vs unusual volatility last year
  - FY25 earnings cadence likely less linear than usual

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and growth drivers
  - Physical expansion: sustained U.S. infill plus international growth; pipeline includes entering 5–6 new country markets over time (timing varies by local processes)
  - E-commerce/logistics: strong big-and-bulky momentum; Costco Logistics delivered 4.5M items in FY24 (+29%); BOPIS rolled out for TVs (freight savings offset labor), testing laptops
  - Technology: app-based warehouse inventory checks; upgraded mobile search doubled CTR; membership card scanners at doors improving throughput and renewals; ~350 U.S. warehouses deployed
  - Private label/Kirkland Signature: continued penetration growth (high-20s% of sales) with price investments and innovation; global sourcing/localized production driving cost and emission reductions
  - Emerging revenue: building retail media capabilities; intent to reinvest majority of media dollars to grow top line and offset e-commerce costs
- Pricing/value
  - Select price reductions (e.g., KS Foil, Macadamia Nuts, Spanish Olive Oil, Baguette) and sustainable packaging change (KS laundry packs) passed through to members
  - Localizing KS paper towel production in Japan, migrating other Asian markets—~30% price cut (~$8/unit), ~ $30M annual member savings, lower freight/emissions
- Workforce
  - Continued wage investments (Sept 2023, March 2024, July 2024); average wage now just north of $30/hour in U.S./Canada; succession planning; promote-from-within culture (85% of 95 new warehouse managers started hourly)

4) Q&A Highlights
- SG&A leverage vs wage reinvestment: Strategy balances member value and employee investment with productivity and sales leverage; aim to fund investments via margin and SG&A efficiencies
- Membership card scanners: Improved front-end productivity; better real-time traffic management; visible lift in signups and renewals; goal is smoother throughput and experience
- Supply chain/port strike risk: Non-foods ~25% of sales; subset imported. Pre-shipped holiday goods, cleared ports, alternate port plans; potential disruption depends on length; freight spot rates peaked and are easing; majority under contract
- Margin drivers: Ancillary strength split between e-commerce and gas; e-commerce benefiting from mix, fulfillment efficiency, sell-through; gas stable over time (quarter not atypical)
- New unit growth mix: FY25 includes 12 international openings; domestic vs international mix reflects permitting/timing rather than strategy shift; continued North America infill runway
- MFI increase: Minimal early-year P&L impact due to deferrals; reinvestments already underway (wages, pricing, KS innovation); FY25 earnings cadence less linear
- Kirkland Signature: Penetration growing; cap on KS margin maintained; mix, global buying, and local production provide tailwind while enabling price investment
- Inflation outlook: Overall flat; fresh slightly inflationary (produce); bakery deflation from commodity inputs; selective pressures in butter/cocoa/eggs/cheese; no major change vs 4Q
- E-commerce penetration/profitability: High single-digit of sales as reported; including digitally initiated grocery (Instacart/Uber) would be double-digit; profitability improving but remains below in-warehouse; leverage from volume and fulfillment productivity
- Gas and traffic: Gas gallons +3% YoY; lower gas prices don’t indicate traffic pressure in warehouses
- Pre-tax margin: Not a target; multiple levers to invest in price while improving margin (global buy, KS mix, e-comm, retail media, shrink improvements)
- Wage level: Average wage just over $30/hour in U.S./Canada
- Bullion: Strong online tailwind; no plans for KS-branded bullion

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Non-food momentum improving as inflation eases; members choiceful and deal-seeking in discretionary; continued shift toward at-home food; alcohol softer
- Cost outlook: Freight largely contracted; spot easing; mixed commodity backdrop; supply chain mostly stable; Red Sea still a minor pain point
- Capital allocation: Ongoing wage investment; proactive price reductions; FY24 capex $4.7B; $1B debt repaid in 4Q; prior $6.7B special dividend depresses FY25 1H interest income
- Forward surprises vs expectations:
  - Strong e-commerce comps and improving profitability metrics
  - Gross margin expansion despite price investments; core-on-core positive
  - MFI increase timing pushes benefit to 2H FY25/FY26
  - Average wage >$30/hour underscores continued reinvestment

6) Takeaways
- Solid underlying growth: Normalized sales +7.3%; normalized EPS +12.6% with broad-based comp strength and traffic +6.4%.
- Margin quality improving: GM +40 bps (ex-gas +33 bps) led by e-commerce and gas; core-on-core +9 bps; shrink improving; SG&A held despite wage headwind.
- Member flywheel intact: Renewal rates stable globally; younger mix of new members; door scanners enhancing throughput and renewals; MFI increase with disciplined reinvestment.
- Expansion and digital momentum: 26 net new warehouses planned in FY25 (12 OUS); e-comm comps +19% with big-and-bulky logistics, BOPIS expansion, app upgrades.
- Watch items: Port strike risk, Red Sea disruptions, 1H FY25 interest income headwind, and a less linear FY25 earnings cadence; promotional intensity in CE/appliances.

7) Other Notable Information

- Costco Next: 86 vendors; ~40% YoY gross sales growth (normalized)
- Sustainability wins tied to cost: Packaging reductions (e.g., KS laundry packs) and localized manufacturing lower emissions and prices
- Upcoming disclosure: September sales (5 weeks ending Oct 6) to be released after market close on Oct 9, 2024
- E-commerce scale: App downloads ~39M cumulative; traffic, conversion, and AOV up; BOPIS TVs rolled out U.S.-wide; testing laptops
- Workforce: Promote-from-within remains core (85% of new warehouse managers started hourly); average wage now just north of $30/hour in U.S./Canada
