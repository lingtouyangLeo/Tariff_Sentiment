*Model: gpt-5*

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AppLovin (APP); Quarter: Q3 FY2024 (ended Sep 30, 2024)
- Context/positioning:
  - Management emphasized “founder-mode” culture and operational discipline; CEO took direct oversight of HR to preserve culture.
  - Core growth thesis: base growth of ~4–5% QoQ from self-learning/market growth, with periodic “step changes” from Axon AI model enhancements.
  - Early-stage but accelerating AI innovation internally and industry-wide expected to continue powering performance.
  - E-commerce advertising is in pilot; early results “best product” the company has launched; nearly 100% incrementality for many merchants; self-serve launch planned in coming quarters; expected to scale notably in 2025.
  - Disclosure cadence change: moving from quarterly to annual shareholder letters (still providing quarterly results and guidance).

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q3 2024 results:
  - Revenue: $1.20B (+39% YoY)
  - Adjusted EBITDA: $722M (+72% YoY); margin 60%; ~91% revenue-to-EBITDA flow-through
  - Free Cash Flow: $545M (+182% YoY; +22% QoQ); 76% EBITDA-to-FCF conversion
  - Cash & equivalents: $568M; Shares outstanding: 335M
- Segment detail:
  - Software Platform (to be renamed “Advertising” next filings): Revenue $835M (+66% YoY); Adj. EBITDA $653M (+79% YoY); margin 78%; QoQ flow-through 107% (normalized ~100% after backing out non-recurring cost benefits)
    - Non-recurring cost favorability this quarter: Google Cloud renewal, prior-quarter PSU vesting timing, FX
    - Expect slightly lower flow-through next quarter due to PSU vesting and increased data center capacity
  - Apps: Revenue $363M (+1% YoY); Adj. EBITDA $68M; margin 19%; expected to remain stable
- Capital allocation:
  - Repurchased/withheld 5M shares for $437M in Q3; buyback authorization increased by $2B; remaining authorization $2.3B
  - Targeting net debt leverage <2x
- Q4 2024 guidance:
  - Revenue: $1.24–$1.26B
  - Adjusted EBITDA: $740–$760M
  - Targeted Adj. EBITDA margin: ~60%

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Axon-driven “step change” materially boosted Q3, primarily within mobile gaming advertisers
  - Long runway in gaming; demand constrained by ROAS and tech; Axon improvements unlock more UA spend and expand the overall market, not just share-shift
  - E-commerce pilot performance exceeds expectations; focus on building self-serve and reallocating talent to go-to-market; anticipate significant 2025 contribution and longer-term multi-vertical expansion beyond e-commerce
  - Longer-term vision: serve any transactional advertiser (gaming, e-comm, gambling, local, lead-gen, etc.)
- Infrastructure and partnerships:
  - Renewed Google Cloud early to secure capacity; one of the world’s largest GPU deployments; investing ahead of consumption to enable more complex models
- Naming/Reporting:
  - “Software Platform” to be renamed “Advertising” to better reflect business
- M&A and portfolio:
  - No M&A planned on the advertising side; Apps optimized for profitability and could be divested if opportunity arises

4) Q&A Highlights
- E-commerce:
  - Pilot revenue contribution immaterial in Q3; ramp expected in 2025; general availability targeted via self-serve “some point next year”
  - Brand awareness in e-comm is a consideration, but management expects product-led, organic adoption given strong ROAS/incrementality; social buzz already visible
  - “Material” as 10%+ of revenue will take time given current scale; Q1 seasonality exists for mature e-comm, but pilot stage blunts seasonality effects
  - Axon licensing to third parties remains longer-term; current priority is scaling e-comm demand
- Beyond e-commerce:
  - Confidence the model can extend to many transactional verticals over time
- Supply expansion:
  - Supply is not a current constraint; long-term plans include expanding beyond mobile games (e.g., CTV via Wurl)
- Capital allocation:
  - Ongoing buybacks remain attractive despite stock price appreciation; focus remains organic growth
- Market dynamics:
  - Growth is not primarily share gain; Axon improvements expand the gaming UA pie and TAM growth potential
- Tech/measurement:
  - Frequent step-ups driven by internal/external AI research integration into Axon
  - iOS probabilistic billing switch in August had nominal impact—primarily alignment/accuracy
- GenAI creative:
  - Personalized creative on roadmap; expected to lift response rates over time, but no near-term timing

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Highly confident and execution-focused; emphasizes durability of 20–30%+ growth potential in gaming alone, with upside from model enhancements and new verticals
- Demand trends: Strong advertiser appetite; Axon improvements directly translate to higher spend; e-comm pilot shows strong ROAS and incrementality
- Cost outlook: Investing ahead in GPUs/cloud capacity; near-term slight flow-through headwind from PSU vesting and data center expansion; still targeting ~60% margin
- Capital allocation: Aggressive buybacks with expanded authorization; leverage discipline maintained
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Positive: Sizeable Axon-driven step-up, strong FCF, higher software margins with non-recurring tailwinds, larger buyback authorization, e-comm pilot strength
  - Disclosure: Move to annual shareholder letters may reduce quarterly narrative detail

6) Takeaways
- Q3 outperformance driven by Axon improvements, with robust 60% EBITDA margin, 72% EBITDA growth, and strong FCF conversion.
- E-commerce pilot is the most compelling new product to date; self-serve slated for 2025 with potential to be a meaningful growth vector beyond gaming.
- Base growth remains 4–5% QoQ with potential periodic step changes; 20–30% YoY growth achievable in gaming alone, with upside from further model advances.
- Investing ahead in cloud/GPU capacity to sustain AI innovation; expect minor near-term flow-through headwinds from PSU and infrastructure scaling.
- Shareholder-friendly capital allocation continues: significant buybacks, added authorization, leverage discipline; no ad-side M&A planned, apps could be divested opportunistically.
