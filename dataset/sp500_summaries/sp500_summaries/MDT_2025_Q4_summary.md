1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Medtronic plc (MDT); Fiscal Q4 FY25 (quarter ended April 25, 2025)
- Participants: CEO Jeff Martha, CFO Thierry Piatone (first MDT earnings call), portfolio segment EVPs
- Macro/industry context highlighted:
  - Potential US–China tariff headwinds; 90-day pause; mitigation plans underway
  - FX headwinds in FY25; expected to turn to a tailwind into FY27 at recent rates
  - Global Pillar 2 tax increasing effective tax rate
  - Strong procedure environment; PFA ablation market ≈$10B, growing double digits
  - US RDN reimbursement process (CMS NCD) pending; draft by July 13, final by Oct 11
  - Hospital systems preparing new service lines (RDN); stable demand in spine; continued adoption of surgical robotics and AI

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q4 FY25 (organic unless noted):
  - Revenue: $8.9B, +5.4% organic; broad-based strength (U.S. +5%, strongest in 15 quarters; Japan HSD; Western Europe and EM MSD)
  - Adjusted EPS: $1.62, +11% (+16% cc); above expectations
  - Adjusted gross margin: 65.1%, -70 bps YoY (flat cc); mix headwinds (CAS, Diabetes) and FX offset by pricing and COGS efficiencies
  - Adjusted operating margin: 27.8%, +90 bps YoY (+200 bps cc); operating profit +7.6% ($175M)
- FY25 (full year):
  - Organic revenue +5%; adjusted EPS +6% (+10% cc)
  - Capital returns: $6.3B via buybacks/dividends; dividend increased for 48th consecutive year
- FY26 Guidance:
  - Organic revenue growth ≈5% (Q1: 4.5–5%)
  - EPS (including current tariff assumptions): $5.50–$5.60
  - EPS growth ex-tariffs: ≈+4%; operating profit growth ≈+7% (ex-tariffs), with R&D growing faster than revenue
  - Q1 EPS: $1.22–$1.24 (minimal tariff effect; 1–2% FX headwind)
  - Tariffs: Net COGS impact estimated $200–$350M in FY26 after mitigation; quarterly phasing minimal in Q1, then ~10% (Q2), ~30% (Q3), ~60% (Q4)
- FY27 Outlook:
  - Expect return to high-single-digit EPS growth, supported by revenue growth, FX tailwind at recent rates, and accretion/share retirement from Diabetes separation

3) Management Commentary
- Portfolio performance and growth drivers:
  - Cardiovascular (CV) +8%: CAS (cardiac ablation solutions) nearly +30%; Structural Heart +10%; Cardiac Surgery DD; CRM +7%
    - PFA: Afera Sphere-9 multi-function catheter driving share gains; Sphere-360 single-shot showed strong 1-year data; US pivotal to start this calendar year
    - EV-ICD (Aurora) adoption accelerating; Micra leadless pacing +17%; 3830 CSP lead +19%
    - Evolut TAVR gaining share on SMART trial superiority vs. leading competitor; FX Plus launch aiding
    - RDN (Symplicity): building infrastructure ahead of CMS coverage; hiring and service-line buildouts underway
  - Neuroscience:
    - Cranial & Spinal Technologies: MSD growth; US +7%; Able (AI-enabled) ecosystem (>10k capital units) deepening moat; winning share and talent
    - Neuromodulation: +10%; SCS (Inceptiv closed-loop) US +15%, global leadership in SCS; Adaptive DBS (BrainSense) FDA-cleared; full releases in US/EU; Japan imminent
  - Medical Surgical:
    - Surgical +2%; advanced energy (LigaSure) share gains 11th straight quarter
    - Hugo soft-tissue robotics: US urology filing; pivotal met endpoints; hernia/benign GYN to follow; GYN oncology trial enrollment soon; installed base across 30 countries; growing utilization; adding instrumentation (LigaSure on Hugo)
    - Touch Surgery AI ecosystem expanding globally
  - Diabetes:
    - +12%, sixth consecutive DD quarter; 780G installs growing; Simplera Sync CGM driving mid-teens CGM growth OUS; US FDA approval in April; US launch this fall
    - Abbott-based sensor integration progressing; interoperable pump/controller submitted; 780G label expansion submitted (Type 2; rapid-acting insulins); next-gen MiniMed Flex (“8 series”) targeted submission by FY-end
- Strategic portfolio action:
  - Plan to separate Diabetes via two-step capital markets path: IPO up to 20% then split-off (target completion within 18 months)
  - Rationale: Diabetes B2C profile, distinct go-to-market/manufacturing; sharpen Medtronic focus on higher-margin B2B growth platforms (PFA, RDN, robotics); improves margins and risk profile
  - Expected impact upon full separation: +~50 bps adjusted gross margin; +~100 bps adjusted operating margin; immediately EPS accretive via share retirement; dividend policy unchanged
- Operations:
  - Pricing discipline (especially with new products); dynamic pricing in EM
  - COGS programs outpacing inflation; labor efficiency up HSD; insourced three DCs; scrap/obsolescence down
  - Increased R&D (first time in four years to outpace revenue), targeted to CAS, RDN, Hugo; G&A leverage to fund growth

4) Q&A Highlights
- Guidance philosophy: Confident 5% organic growth; running business internally to higher targets; operating profit to outgrow sales despite higher R&D
- Below-the-line headwinds: Tax rate rising from ~16.7% to ~18% (Pillar 2, safe harbor uncertainty); interest expense higher on refinancing; combined ~300 bps EPS growth impact
- FX: Building natural hedges and pricing mechanisms; expect FX to flip to a tailwind into FY27 at recent rates
- CAS ramp: Supply improving; capital placements precede high-margin catheter pull-through; doubling CAS from ~$1B seen as near-term (not necessarily within FY), Sphere-360 to intensify competitiveness
- Cryo in CAS: Decline moderating; remains valued in non-GA/cost-constrained settings
- RDN: Hospitals building service lines; expect longer ramp than PFA but durable annuity; anticipate CMS coverage aligned with trial evidence/guidelines (uncontrolled or med-intolerant patients)
- Diabetes pipeline specifics: Simplera Sync US limited launch in fall; OUS ramp already strong; ACE pump + iAGC algorithm filed (April); next-gen durable pump filing by FY-end; patch to follow; phone control; 3rd-gen fully automated algorithm; unified digital experience
- Spine: Able ecosystem driving above-market MSD/HSD growth; large centers converting; competitor challenges noted; enabling tech dictates implant decisions
- Portfolio management: Ongoing; prior exits (ventilation, LVAD, dialysis); plan for tuck-in M&A; fundamentals strong, enabling more deals

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and execution-focused; emphasis on durable growth drivers and operating leverage despite macro headwinds
- Forward-looking:
  - Investments accelerating in CAS, RDN, Hugo to capture scaling US launches
  - Expect meaningful RDN revenue ramp post-CMS NCD
  - Diabetes separation enhances margin mix and EPS via share retirement; reduces dividend cash burden
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Q4 revenue/EPS beat; strongest US growth in 15 quarters
  - Clear FY26 topline guide (single point ~5%) and explicit tariff framework
  - Diabetes separation (IPO + split-off) with quantifiable margin/EPS benefits
  - FY27 high-single-digit EPS growth framework signaled two years ahead

6) Takeaways
- Solid Q4 capstone: 5.4% organic growth and 11% EPS growth with operating margin expansion; back-half FY25 EPS +9%
- Growth engines accelerating: CAS near +30%, Structural Heart +10%, Neuromod +10%, CST US +7%; PFA leadership ambition with expanding portfolio; TAVR share gains on superior data
- Strategic simplification: Diabetes spin (IPO/split-off) sharpens focus on higher-margin B2B platforms; expected to lift margins and be EPS accretive via share retirement
- FY26 guide balanced: ~5% organic growth; operating profit +~7% (ex tariffs) despite R&D step-up; EPS pressured by tariffs/taxes/interest to ~4% ex tariffs; EPS range $5.50–$5.60 including tariffs
- Visibility to FY27: High-single-digit EPS growth expected as tariff drag eases, FX turns tailwind, and diabetes separation benefits flow through

7) Other Notable Information
- Tariffs: Net FY26 COGS impact estimated $200–$350M after mitigations; limited Q1 effect with back-half weighted impact; updates to be provided as assumptions evolve
- Capital returns/dividend: $6.3B returned in FY25; 48th consecutive annual dividend increase
- Leadership changes: Sean Salmon (CV EVP) departing after >20 years; Skip Kiil to lead Cardiovascular; CFO Thierry Piatone (12 weeks in role) emphasizing cost, FX, and operating rigor
