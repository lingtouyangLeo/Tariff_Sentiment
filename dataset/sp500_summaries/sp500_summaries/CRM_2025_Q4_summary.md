  - Mix/Assumptions: Professional Services remains a growth headwind; marketing/commerce weaker; expansion base growth slower; AgentForce revenue contribution modest in FY26, building into FY27.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and Product
  - AgentForce and Data Cloud positioned as a multi‑billion ARR runway; Data + AI ARR exited at ~$900M, +~120% YoY.
  - Data Cloud scaled past 50 trillion records (≈25% via zero‑copy from external sources); foundation for AI/agents.
  - Unified “trinity”: Customer 360 apps + Data Cloud + Agentic layer (AgentForce) on one platform; emphasis on trust, security, and accuracy.
  - Slack: nearly 5B messages weekly; becoming the hub for digital labor across employees.
  - Tableau Next unveiled (agentic, data cloud‑native, conversational analytics); new Field Service; glimpse of ITSM under development.
- Go-to-Market and Ecosystem
  - Partners in 50% of AgentForce wins and 70% of activations in Q4; 127k+ SI employees trained; 1,000+ ISVs building agents.
  - Expanded Google partnership (Gemini models and Salesforce on GCP); AWS drove 25 $1M+ deals (3 >$10M) in Q4.
- Financial and Operations
  - Continued margin discipline with reinvestment in high‑growth areas (AgentForce, Data Cloud).
  - Pricing evolution: mix of seat (human) and consumption (agents/data); move toward universal credits for flexibility.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Pricing/Monetization of Agents:
  - Transitioning to a mix of human seat-based plus consumption for agents/data; universal credits likely near-term.
  - Case example: large telco deal ≈$20M ACV with ~$7M AgentForce component alongside core clouds.
  - Early customer ROI and time-to-value cited as accelerating deal velocity and upsell to core.
- Halo Effect:
  - Agents are lifting core cloud demand and usage; customers adopting multi-cloud to operationalize agents across workflows.
- Leadership/Org:
  - CFO and COO roles combined into COFO; board member Robin Washington to assume role. Reinforced bench: CRO Miguel Milano (reports to CEO), CTO Steve Fisher, Chief Engineering & Services Srini, Chief Product & Impact David Schmaier, CLO Sebastian Niles.
- Labor/Productivity Impact:
  - Anticipates workforce augmentation: internal examples include 84% autonomous resolution on help portal; 30% engineering productivity gain; no new engineering hires planned FY26; potential 10–20% sales capacity growth.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Strong multi-cloud/AI pull; nearly half of Fortune 100 are both AI and Data Cloud customers; all top 10 Q4 wins included AI and Data Cloud.
- Cost outlook:
  - Benefiting from hyperscaler pricing; Capex steady at ~2% of revenue; margin expansion to continue (+100 bps FY26).
- Capital allocation:
  - Ongoing buybacks/dividends; FCF growth guidance +9–10%.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Strong CF, margin, and RPO; AgentForce adoption robust (3,000+ paid in 90 days) but revenue recognition cautious (modest FY26 contribution, larger FY27), which may temper near-term AI revenue expectations.

6) Takeaways
- AI commercialization is real but revenue ramps over time: 3,000+ AgentForce customers and strong AI/Data Cloud ARR growth, with monetization modeled modestly in FY26 and building in FY27.
- Durable fundamentals: Record CF, continued margin expansion, double‑digit CRPO growth cc, and RPO >$60B reinforce visibility despite FX and services headwinds.
- Unified platform advantage: Customer 360 + Data Cloud + AgentForce is driving larger, multi-cloud deals and measurable productivity/ROI for customers and internally.
- GTM leverage via ecosystem: High partner involvement and hyperscaler relationships support faster deployments, lower costs, and broader reach.
- Balanced risks: FX headwinds, EMEA softness, pro services drag, weaker marketing/commerce, and early-stage agent adoption curve.

7) Other Notable Information
- Internal AgentForce metrics:
  - 380k autonomous service requests since October with 84% resolution; only 2% escalated to humans.
  - Quoting cycles >75% faster; AE productivity +7% YoY while increasing capacity; agent-driven prospecting (50+ leads/day).
- Industry/vertical traction:
  - Industry business plus Public Sector/.org ARR ≈$5.7B, +20% YoY; 170+ prebuilt AgentForce industry skills; 400 specialists.
