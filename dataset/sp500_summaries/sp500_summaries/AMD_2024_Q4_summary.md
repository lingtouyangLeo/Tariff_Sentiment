3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and products
  - Data Center CPUs: 5th-gen EPYC “Turin” ramp; >50% share at most largest hyperscalers exiting 2024; >1,000 EPYC instances (+27% YoY); Azure custom EPYC with HBM; expanding enterprise OEM/ODM platforms (>450 total; >120 Turin platforms entered production in Q4).
  - Data Center AI (Instinct accelerators & software):
    - 2024 Data center AI revenue >$5B.
    - MI300X scaled at Meta (Llama 405B on Meta.ai) and Microsoft (Copilot services; large training/inference instances); deployments across >a dozen CSPs; >25 MI300 platforms in production with major OEMs/ODMs.
    - Software: ROCm enhancements (v6.3, FlashAttention, SGLang); 2.7x inference perf improvement since launch; >1M Hugging Face models run on AMD; biweekly container releases to accelerate out-of-box experience.
    - Product roadmap:
      - MI325X: volume production began Q4; ramp “progressing very well.”
      - MI350 (CDNA4): 35x AI compute uplift vs CDNA3; early silicon strong; sampling lead customers now; production shipments pulled forward to mid-2025.
      - MI400 (CDNA Next): 2026 launch; rack-scale integration of networking/CPU/GPU; larger memory and bandwidth; open scale-up/scale-out networking.
  - ZT Systems acquisition: multiple unconditional approvals; close expected 1H; plan to divest ZT’s US manufacturing shortly after close; customers positive on accelerating Instinct platforms.
  - Client/PC: Record desktop channel sell-out; AI PC leadership with full Copilot Plus CPU portfolio across segments; expanded Dell partnership for full Ryzen Pro commercial portfolio (initial launch spring, broader 2H ramp); 22 new mobile Ryzen parts at CES.
  - Gaming: Semi-custom cyclical normalization expected in 2025 after 2024 channel inventory drawdowns; cumulative console units >100M. Radeon 9000 series (RDNA4) targets high-volume enthusiast tier; better ray tracing and AI upscaling; Radeon 9070 series on sale early March.
  - Embedded/Adaptive: Q4 down YoY; market mixed. Portfolio expansion (Versal RF; Versal Premium Gen2 with CXL 3.1/PCIe Gen6; next-gen Alveo for ultra-low-latency trading). Record $14B design wins in 2024 (+25% YoY), expecting share gains.
- Risks/challenges
  - Competitive intensity in server CPUs and accelerators; product transition timing (MI325/MI350); embedded market softness; console cycle normalization; networking/system-level scaling critical for AI clusters.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Data center GPU trajectory
  - 1H25 Data Center segment (server + GPU) expected roughly consistent with 2H24; H2 stronger than H1 as MI350 ramps; MI350 pull-in to mid-year improves competitiveness; new 300/325 wins deploy in H1.
  - Q1 sequential: Data Center down ~corporate average; Client/Embedded down more; Gaming down less (post-normalization).
  - Exit-rate commitment: Management affirmed 2025 GPU exit rate higher than 2024.
- Server CPU (EPYC)
  - Q4 server up double-digit sequentially; both cloud and enterprise grew.
  - Enterprise demand improving with increased go-to-market investments; broader platform coverage; confident on share gains despite competitive pricing.
- AI model/ASIC debates
  - DeepSeek and similar advances seen as positive for AI adoption and compute demand.
  - Expect heterogeneous compute (CPU/GPU/ASIC/FPGA); ASICs included in TAM but remain smaller than GPUs given rapid algorithm change; AMD participates in ASIC engagements leveraging IP portfolio.
- Networking for AI
  - Ethernet-based approach with partners; Pensando team building AMD AI NIC; scaling to rack-level solutions with MI350 and MI400; more proof points in training and inference clusters.
- Client PCs
  - Strong Q4 without evidence of inventory build; desktop demand above seasonality into Q1; mobile seasonality typical; confident in outgrowing PC TAM in 2025.
- Gross margin outlook
  - Q1 at ~54% on mix; 1H similar if mix holds; step-up in 2H25 as Data Center accelerates.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking
  - AMD positions Instinct franchise to scale from >$5B in 2024 to “tens of billions” annually over coming years; MI350 acceleration and MI400 rack-scale integration underpin confidence.
  - Expect demand to strengthen across all businesses in 2025; Data Center and Client lead growth; Gaming and Embedded modestly higher.
  - Capital allocation: Continued buybacks; strong FCF; inventory built to support ramps.
- Surprises vs expectations
  - Positive: MI350 production pull-in to mid-2025; strong Q4 Client outperformance; firm stance on higher 2025 GPU exit rate; commitment to 2H gross margin step-up.
  - Caution: Q1 sequential decline across segments (seasonality/product transition); embedded recovery slower than anticipated; limited quantitative 2025 GPU guide (shifting to segment-level guidance).

6) Takeaways
- Data Center remains the growth engine: EPYC share gains and Instinct accelerators drove record results; 2025 weighted to 2H as MI350 ramps; 2025 GPU exit rate to exceed 2024.
- AI roadmap accelerating: MI325 in volume; MI350 pulled forward with strong early silicon; MI400 targets rack-scale leadership; ROCm momentum improving developer experience and performance.
- Client strength durable: AI PC-led portfolio breadth, record desktop sell-out, and new Dell commercial partnership position AMD to outgrow a mid-single-digit PC TAM in 2025.
- Mix-driven margin expansion in 2H: Q1 GM steady at ~54%; anticipated 2H uplift as Data Center mix increases and AI products ramp.
- Watch points: Competitive pricing in server CPUs; execution through product transitions and networking scale-ups; embedded end-market recovery pace; console cycle normalization trajectory.
