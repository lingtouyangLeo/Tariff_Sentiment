1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Jabil Inc. (JBL)
- Period: Fiscal 4Q24 and full-year FY2024; FY2025 outlook and new segment framework introduced
- Context/industry backdrop:
  - 2024 was challenging but strategically important: divested Mobility for $2.2B, significant buybacks, and internal reorganization
  - Macro headwinds: softness in EVs, 5G infrastructure, renewables/solar; cyclicality in semi-cap; muted consumer; higher rates
  - Structural tailwinds: AI-driven data center buildouts, healthcare outsourcing/complexity, warehouse automation; IRA incentives in U.S.
  - New reporting segments in FY25: Regulated Industries (Healthcare, Auto & Transport, Renewables/Energy), Intelligent Infrastructure (Cloud/DCI, Networking/Comms, Semi-cap), Connected Living & Digital Commerce (consumer, retail/warehouse automation)

  - Tax: 21% core tax rate in FY25; expect 23–24% beyond FY25 (Pillar 2 global minimum tax)

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/organization:
  - Enterprise strategy intact; sharpened on profitable growth and risk reduction
  - New 3-segment model to emphasize domain expertise, speed, and customer care
  - Leadership: segment heads (Borges, Crowley, Priestley); Ops lead (McCoy); Supply Chain lead (Makai)
- Portfolio moves:
  - Completed exit of legacy networking customer (~$700M FY24 revenue; fully out by Aug 31); balance sheet exposure closed
  - No footprint restructuring planned; SG&A/headcount actions underway
- Capacity/utilization:
  - Global footprint balanced across Americas/Europe/Asia; ~70% utilization vs typical 80–85%
  - Capacity supports $30B+ revenue; carrying excess capacity in FY25 (20–30 bps core margin headwind) to capture recovery
  - Croatia facility pivoting from Auto to GLP-1 healthcare; DR and India expansion underway
- Segment updates:
  - Regulated Industries:
    - Healthcare: strong outsourcing trend; GLP-1 injectors expanding (Europe), wins in diabetes wearables/CGMs; surgical robotics and diagnostics growth; long validation cycles (material impact FY26–FY27)
    - Auto & Transport: near-term EV demand volatility (tariffs, incentives, rates, charging concerns) with program push-outs; added OEMs and vehicle-agnostic content; long-term EV growth still 25–30% CAGR to 2030
    - Renewables/Energy: modest growth from IRA-driven U.S. localizations; energy storage/battery modules; HVAC/building controls; conservative on residential/commercial solar rebound in FY25
  - Intelligent Infrastructure:
    - AI is the next cloud cycle; manufacturing at the center of power/cooling (liquid cooling), photonics (800G/1.6T), advanced packaging (co-packaged optics), and retrofits (air-to-liquid, liquid-to-liquid)
    - Photonics business landed two new hyperscalers; Pune, India executing well; expanding India footprint
    - Expect Intelligent Infrastructure to be up ~$1B YoY in FY25 ex-legacy networking exit
  - Connected Living & Digital Commerce:
    - Leading in POS/self-checkout, ESLs, warehouse automation; builds >1,000 warehouse robots/month plus sub-assemblies that power ~4,000/month; early engagement in humanoid robotics
    - FY25 growth led by Digital Commerce; Connected Living demand more muted

4) Q&A Highlights
- AI/cloud/DCI:
  - FY25 growth ~12% YoY ex-legacy networking; consignment impact small
  - AI-related margins in line to slightly accretive vs enterprise; ~$1B YoY Intelligent Infrastructure uplift: ~50% cloud/DCI; remainder split between photonics and capital equipment
  - Photonics progress: shipping to two new hyperscalers; 800G qualification now; 1.6T in CY25
  - Pricing pressure is “always present,” manageable; potential for supply chain consolidation but nothing atypical
- Semi-cap:
  - ~20% growth driven by ATE attach to AI GPUs; earlier-than-expected WFE recovery
- Healthcare:
  - Market growing ~3–4%; FY25 growth modest given GLP-1 impact on bariatric surgeries but offset by injectors/CGMs; strong pipeline incl. potential divestitures
- Auto:
  - Near-term negative leverage modest due to push-outs; long-term positioned across OEMs/vehicle-agnostic content; Croatia launch on time
- Utilization/margins:
  - Utilization ~70%; no capacity reduction planned; underutilization 20–30 bps drag in FY25
  - Back-half EPS/margin ramp from EMS seasonality, mix, booked ramps; buybacks opportunistic across the year
- Cash flow:
  - FY25 FCF ~$1.2B supported by lower capex (~$200M YoY reduction) and working capital improvements
- Pricing/competition:
  - No broad-based pricing deterioration assumed in FY25 margin outlook
- Election impact:
  - Some “wait-and-see” in EVs/renewables; long-term outlook for both end markets remains constructive

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward view:
  - Conservative second-half weighting based on booked business rather than aggressive recovery assumptions
  - Continued high-return capital deployment (80% of FCF), $1B FY25 buyback, disciplined capex
  - Long-term framework reiterated: enterprise revenue CAGR 5–7%; gross margin 9–10%; core op margin target 6%; EPS growth 12–15%; ROIC >30%
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - 4Q revenue and core EPS above guidance midpoints; EMS margin strength (+90 bps YoY)
  - Clear exit from legacy networking; prudent stance on EV/renewables; underutilization headwind disclosed

6) Takeaways
- Jabil beat in 4Q and delivered >$1B FY24 FCF despite ~$6B YoY revenue decline, highlighting improved resilience and mix quality.
- FY25 outlook is conservative and back-half weighted, with AI/data center, photonics, and warehouse automation as principal growth drivers; EV/renewables remain soft near term.
- New 3-segment structure aligns with domain expertise and investment priorities; intelligent infrastructure up ~$1B YoY (ex-legacy networking), healthcare pipeline sets up FY26–FY27.
- Margin headwinds from intentional excess capacity (20–30 bps) and higher future tax rates (Pillar 2) temper near-term expansion; long-term 6% margin target reaffirmed.
- Strong balance sheet/liquidity and $1B buyback authorization support continued shareholder returns (targeting ~80% of FCF).
