1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: UDR, Inc. (NYSE: UDR)
- Period: Q4 2024 and FY 2024 results; 2025 outlook provided
- Context and macro/industry backdrop:
  - Management expects resilient U.S. economic growth and apartment demand in 2025, with a better backdrop in 2H25 as supply pressures abate from 2024 peaks.
  - Renting remains far more affordable than owning (~60% cheaper to rent than own; a 25% improvement vs. pre-COVID), rent-to-income ratios remain below long-term averages, and the largest U.S. age cohorts are in prime renter years.
  - Multifamily development starts are down ~65% from recent highs; 2025 deliveries trend toward historical averages and should decline below average in 2H25.
  - Sun Belt 2025 supply ~4% of inventory (about 2x coastal), but down by roughly one-third vs. 2024; coastal supply roughly similar to 2024.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q4 and FY results:
  - FFOA/share: Q4 $0.63; FY $2.48 — both at prior guidance midpoints.
  - Same-store results: Above guidance midpoints; same-store NOI growth exceeded the high end of guidance.
  - Operational setup: Occupancy-focused strategy in Q4 built occupancy by +50 bps vs. Q3; early 2025 occupancy >97% (~30 bps higher than Q4 average).
- 2025 guidance:
  - FFOA/share: $2.45–$2.55 (midpoint $2.50; ~+1% YoY).
  - Same-store revenue growth: 1.25%–3.25% (midpoint 2.25%).
  - Same-store expense growth: ~3.5% (midpoint), with insurance down 4.5%–6.5% after December renewal; real estate taxes mid-3%s; personnel normalizing after 2024 CARES refund noise.
  - Same-store NOI growth: ~1.75% (midpoint), ~25 bps better than 2024.
  - Building blocks for 2025 FFOA at $2.50 midpoint: 
    - +$0.10 from same-store revenue and lease-up income
    - -(~$0.05) from higher same-store expenses
    - +$0.01 from lower net interest expense (lower average debt balance offsets hedge expirations mid-year)
    - -(~$0.01) from higher G&A/property management (wage inflation)
    - -(~$0.03) from JV and DPE: -$0.02 non-accrual at 1300 Fairmount (Philadelphia) plus -$0.01 from converting a $43m, 12% notes receivable to equity in a pending tech investment sale.
- Q1 2025 guidance:
  - FFOA/share: $0.60–$0.62 (midpoint ~-3% QoQ), driven by normal seasonal expense uptick and lower income from DPE/tech note conversion.

3) Management Commentary
- Operating strategy:
  - Deliberate “occupancy-first” pivot in Q4 to maximize 2024 NOI and enter 2025 peak leasing season with strength; occupancy maintained >97% YTD.
  - Blended lease rate growth expected ~2.5% for 2025 (renewals ~4%, new leases ~1%), with back-half weighting as supply eases; underlying market rents turned positive sequentially early 2025; renewal growth mid-4% and new lease growth bottoming across regions.
- Innovation/customer experience:
  - Innovation/operating initiatives expected to add ~65 bps to 2025 same-store revenue (~$10–$15m), led by property-wide Wi-Fi rollout (10–12k units remaining in 2025), package lockers, amenity monetization, improved retention, and reduced fraud.
  - Customer Experience Project has driven YoY retention improvement for 21 consecutive months; expects 2025 turnover -100 bps vs. 2024 (~$3.5m higher cash flow); January turnover was sub-30% (record low) and early 2025 trends remain favorable.
  - Funnel CRM being implemented over 3–6 months to support centralized ops, omni-channel communications, and online leasing; frees resources to focus on innovation.
  - AI-driven fraud screening (ID/income verification) improving customer quality: higher average deposits (~+20%), more co-signers, credit scores up ~20 points (to ~730).
- External growth and capital allocation:
  - Cost of capital remains elevated; UDR will be opportunistic using JV capital (LaSalle partner back in market), OP-unit structures, and redeployment of DPE payoffs.
  - Development: 2–3 starts expected in 2025 (one potentially next quarter), targeting high-5% to ~6% yields; 4–5 projects could be shovel-ready in ~12 months; costs stabilized; financing availability improving (bank construction spreads ~+300 bps), LP equity remains tight.
  - Redevelopment continues to be active and collaborative with operations.
- Balance sheet/liquidity:
  - Liquidity >$1B plus ~$211m Q1 dispositions; only ~10% consolidated debt matures through 2026; minimal committed capex and strong FCF.
- DPE book:
  - 1300 Fairmount (Philadelphia) moved to non-accrual with reserve taken; management believes this largely de-risked the DPE portfolio.
  - Two watchlist investments total ~ $40m; potential impact ≤ $0.01 of FFOA if placed on non-accrual; improving operating trends and senior loans mature mid-2026.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Pricing cadence and concessions:
  - 2025 blended growth cadence: 1H ~1.4%–1.8%; 2H ~2.8%–3.2% (3Q seasonal peak), still 70–90 bps below pre-COVID norms.
  - Concessions ~1 week in January and trending below one week as 1Q progresses.
- Regional outlook:
  - East Coast (≈40% of NOI): SS revenue +2% to +4%; New York and D.C. leading; Boston cautious due to mid-year supply.
  - West Coast (≈35%): +1.25% to +3.25%; SF, Seattle, Orange County upper-tier; Monterey Peninsula softer (new rent control and utility reimbursement limits pending submetering remediation).
  - Sun Belt (≈25%): flat to +2%; Austin/Nashville face elevated supply; Tampa/Orlando relatively stronger. Sun Belt “other income” growth expected 10%–12% vs. ~5% on the coasts.
- Supply/absorption:
  - 2025 deliveries trend down through the year; sharper Sun Belt improvement vs. 2024, with broader industry supply stepping down further in 2026.
- Expenses:
  - 2025 SS expense ~3.5% midpoint; taxes mid-3%s (negative in Seattle; higher in Boston and Nashville resets); insurance -4.5% to -6.5% due to renewal and targeted capex; personnel normalized after 2024 CARES refund distortion.
- Capital deployment:
  - JV activity with LaSalle resuming; OP-unit deals under discussion; net seller optics in early 2025 reflect 2024 sales slipping into January (not a strategic shift).
  - Acquisition market is competitive; sellers are also bullish; focus on 20–30-year-old value-add assets where operations/redevelopment can drive NOI.
- Development environment:
  - Many developers see stronger 2026–2027 fundamentals, but LP equity remains scarce; banks are easing somewhat. UDR targeting high-5% to ~6% yields; watching tariffs/lumber and leveraging improved labor availability.
- DPE lessons learned:
  - Lower loan-to-cost on new development deals; tighter timelines; deeper market/supply analytics; more scenario analyses; tilt toward operating-asset recaps with current pay (now 30%+ of book).
- Turnover vs. pricing:
  - Framework: ~100 bps rent ≈ $7m annually; 100 bps occupancy ≈ ~$17m; will trade occupancy for rate primarily during peak demand; occupancy gains also reflect better service/retention, not only pricing strategy.
- Tech/CRM:
  - Funnel CRM expected to enhance efficiency and enable more innovation; continued emphasis on owning and mining proprietary customer data.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone/confidence: Cautiously optimistic; confident in H2 2025 acceleration as supply eases; occupancy/retention momentum strong; innovation pipeline sizable.
- Demand/trend signals: Affordability gap vs. ownership likely persists; some “pent-up” household formation from younger cohorts and return-to-office; bad debt trending better due to fraud controls.
- Cost outlook: Insurance a tailwind; taxes manageable; personnel normalized; construction costs stabilized; financing improving but equity selective.
- Capital allocation: Flexibility via liquidity, JV capital, OP units; DPE risk addressed; development measured and yield-focused.
- Surprises vs. expectations: Insurance cost declines, strong early-2025 occupancy/turnover metrics, explicit de-risking of DPE, and continued sizable “other income” contribution.

6) Takeaways
- 2025 fundamentals should improve in 2H as record 2024 supply fades; blended rent growth back-half weighted, with occupancy already >97% and renewals ~4%.
- Guidance implies steady performance: FFOA midpoint +1% YoY; same-store NOI growth ~1.75% (better than 2024) despite 3.5% expense growth.
- Innovation/customer experience remain key differentiators, adding ~65 bps to revenue with tangible gains in retention, fraud reduction, and “other income.”
- Balance sheet/liquidity robust; multiple capital tools (JV, OP units, dispositions) to be opportunistic; DPE largely de-risked; measured development starts at high-5%–6% yields.
- Risks: Regional supply (Sun Belt early 2025), concessions trajectory, tax variability, regulatory actions (e.g., rent control), and policy/immigration uncertainty; all contemplated within guidance ranges.

7) Other Notable Information
- Leadership changes: Mike Lacy promoted to COO; Joe Fisher appointed CIO; CFO search underway.
- Regional regulatory update: Monterey Peninsula enacted rent control and limits on utility reimbursement without submetering; UDR plans submeter installs to recapture income (more 2026–2027 impact). Watching Washington State rent control bills and any California emergency measures.
- 1300 Fairmount (Philadelphia) DPE moved to non-accrual and reserved; two smaller watchlist DPEs (~$40m) remain (≤$0.01 FFOA risk).
- Pending tech investment sale: $43m notes (12% interest) likely to convert to equity (near-term -$0.01 FFOA; viewed as better long-term economics).
- Thousand Oaks DPE: Strong leasing (mid-90s occupancy) aided by post-fire demand; likely short extension and sale in 2025 given good equity/value.
- Weather events: No property damage from Southern California wildfires; winter weather response recognized across portfolio.
