  - Branch expansion: building high-touch/high-tech presence in key growth markets to support full client experience and primary household acquisition.
  - Balance sheet positioning: HTM portfolio continues to roll off (13th straight quarter), reinvested at higher yields; prioritize loan growth and liquidity; no broad securities repositioning planned.
  - Human capital: minimum wage to $24/hour; ongoing advisor hiring and training in wealth.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Rate path uncertainty; dynamic NII sensitivity: +100 bps = +$1.8B NII; −100 bps = −$2.7B over 12 months.
  - CRE office remains a monitored area (losses lower this quarter).
  - Loan demand still modest; revolver utilization still subdued.
  - Regulatory (Basel III endgame) remains pending; management expects re-proposal more favorable than original.

4) Q&A Highlights
- NII trajectory and deposit dynamics:
  - Reaffirmed Q2 trough; NII grew in Q3 and expected to grow again in Q4 despite an extra 25 bps cut in September.
  - Deposit trends stabilizing; noninterest-bearing balances stable; consumer outflows among rate-sensitive, higher-balance clients have slowed; wealth deposits roughly flat recently; total deposit rate paid expected <2% in October due to prompt pass-through.
- 2025 outlook:
  - Detailed NII guidance deferred to January; management expects operating leverage to return in 2025.
- Loan growth:
  - Modest pickup in commercial loan demand late in Q3 across small business, business banking, commercial banking; revolver utilization not yet improving; upside potential if rates fall further.
- Securities/asset repricing tailwinds:
  - Approximate uplift on repricing: ~250 bps on securities, ~250 bps on residential mortgage, ~100 bps on CVL; continued benefit from HTM runoff reinvestment; cash flow swaps reset over time (notably helping commercial yields in H2’25).
  - No plans for portfolio repositioning; AFS largely swapped to floating; balance among capital, liquidity, earnings prioritized.
- Efficiency ratio/expenses:
  - Elevated fee-driven incentive comp a key factor; operating leverage expected as NII grows and credit normalizes; Q4 expenses guided flat with Q3.
- Capital and buybacks:
  - Capital levels support ongoing buybacks ($3.5B Q3) and dividend growth (+8% this quarter); prioritization remains client support, invest for growth, maintain/grow dividend, then repurchases.
  - Basel re-proposal viewed as favorable vs original; more precise capital return calibration after final rules.
- Deposit betas on the way down:
  - Expect meaningful recapture with lower deposit costs; structural value of deposits greater at a neutral rate ~3% than in prior low-rate decade.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals

- Deposits stabilizing, costs declining: Average deposits up for the fifth straight quarter; deposit rate paid expected to fall below 2% in October.
