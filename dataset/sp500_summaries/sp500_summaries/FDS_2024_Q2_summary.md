1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: FactSet Research Systems (NYSE: FDS)
- Period: Fiscal 2Q24 (quarter ended February)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Clients remain cautious; purchasing decisions delayed and headcount pressure persists across buy- and sell-side.
  - Industry cost-cutting appears to be stabilizing; “pockets of recovery” emerging.
  - Consolidation impact: UBS-Credit Suisse headcount reductions weighed on users; ASV impact from Credit Suisse not yet in Q2 but assumed conservatively in full-year outlook.
  - Buy side under structural fee pressure (passive AUM surpassed active in 2023).
  - Capital markets backdrop improving at the margin (Fed signaling potential rate cuts; SNB cut rates; IPO window showing early signs of reopening with Astera Labs and Reddit).

2) Headline Financial Results
- Top line and ASV:
  - GAAP revenue: $546M, +6% YoY (Americas +6.5%, EMEA +4.8%, APAC +6.4%).

  - Adjusted EBITDA: $218M, +9% YoY.
- Cash flow and capital allocation:

  - Share repurchases: 113,050 shares for $52.3M at ~$462 avg; FY24 buyback target $250M ($188M remaining for 2H).
  - Total capital returned LTM: $434.1M (dividends + buybacks).
  - Leverage: Gross leverage 1.8x; repaid $62.5M of term loan; on track to fully repay by 2Q FY25.
- Expenses/mix:
  - GAAP opex: $364M, +5% YoY, including ~$11M restructuring charge.
  - Technology costs: +11% YoY; now ~8.4% of revenue (cloud/GenAI a driver).

  - Third-party content: +3% YoY; Real estate: -8% YoY (footprint “right-sized”).
  - Tax rate: 16.4% (vs. 16.1%).
- Guidance and outlook:
  - Expect FY ASV growth to finish at the low end of 5–7%.
  - Planning to deliver the midpoint of FY adjusted operating margin guidance (~36.5%); implies H2 adjusted margin around ~35% given H1 strength.
  - Expect Q3 to be softer; Q4 to be stronger vs. last year (pipeline later-stage weighted).
  - Lower end of revenue outlook also contemplated; Credit Suisse impact assumed conservatively (timing uncertain).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and product:
  - Expanding managed services (middle office outsourcing, performance services) to lower clients’ total cost of ownership (TCO); complements core subscription business. Acknowledged lower margin profile but enables larger enterprise wins.
  - Leveraging middle-office strength to power front-office solutions; won a front-office displacement in Asia by integrating OMS/EMS and connecting end-to-end workflows via open platform.
  - GenAI roadmap advancing:
    - FactSet Mercury (beta): conversational synthesis across documents and structured data.
    - Transcript Assistant (full release): chatbot for earnings transcripts; strong early uptake; adding event coverage and peer comparisons; integrating with Mercury.
    - Banking tools in beta: Chart Creator; Investment Banking Office Refresh API (automates cloud model updates), first off-platform banker automation revenue opportunity.
    - Developing copilots for PMs and research analysts to reduce time-to-insight.
  - Wealth: Quiet quarter (one large cancellation; no large deals), but deepening partnerships and expanding workflows (prospecting, proposal generation).
  - Organizational changes: Firm-type go-to-market focus and cost reductions to position for upturn.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Fewer large deals in Q2 and lower price uplift vs. prior year; higher erosion (banking; PE/VC retention pressure).
  - Buy-side fee pressure and client headcount reductions; competitive pricing pressure in smaller deals (PE/VC, some banking).
  - APAC: softer banking expansion and a larger asset manager loss; EMEA: lighter institutional AM renewals; Americas: large wealth cancellation (client moved custom workflow in-house).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Pipeline and timing:
  - H2 pipeline healthier than H1, higher deal volume, more late-stage opportunities; many six- and seven-figure deals, above last year by ~5% in count; more skew to Q4 closings.
  - Data solutions, middle office, and quant solutions driving H2 momentum; timing remains a watch item.
- Managed services:
  - Small revenue share today; lower margin, but strategic to win enterprise solutions and outsource workflows (e.g., large outsourced performance deal).
- Pricing/cross-sell/new logos:
  - Americas Q2 price increase contributed ~$25M (in line with FY22; below FY23 inflation-boosted year).
  - Price realization vs. rate card roughly flat YoY; new-business realization lower (more competitive).
  - New logo count higher but smaller average deal sizes.
- Expenses/margin cadence:
  - H2 adjusted operating margin expected around ~35% to land FY at ~36.5%.
  - Tech/cloud and amortization costs ramp with GenAI; personnel costs flat after headcount actions; bonus accrual “low 20s” ($M) in Q3–Q4.
- Macro and demand:
  - Expect Q3 to remain soft; Q4 better. Hiring remains soft; sell-side similar to last year unless rates cut and banks turn more optimistic.
  - TCO-led, C-suite level conversations rising; competitive displacement opportunities increasing; some competitor platforms seen as less flexible/scalable.
- Budget prioritization:
  - Large “premier” clients (41% of revenue) have flat budgets and are reallocating to GenAI initiatives; platform decisions can be delayed; data solutions showing near-term strength.
- GenAI internal efficiency:
  - Three focus areas: engineering productivity, content collection automation, and client support.
  - Largest savings likely in engineering; expect cost avoidance/hiring moderation benefits to begin showing in FY25 (to be reflected in FY25 guidance).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Cautiously optimistic. Stabilizing customer environment with improving pipeline; Q3 softer, Q4 stronger.
- Forward-looking:
  - Continued cost discipline while investing in GenAI; cloud/tech spend to rise in H2.
  - Focus on TCO narrative and enterprise/platform displacements; strong interest from asset owners and wealth over time.
  - Deleveraging continues; buybacks ongoing.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Mixed top line but better-than-expected profitability (EPS +11%, margin +130 bps) despite slower ASV.
  - Lower-end ASV outlook and wealth cancellation a negative; improved late-stage pipeline and new AI product traction a positive.

6) Takeaways
- Profitability resilient: Strong cost control and capitalization benefits drove 130 bps adjusted margin expansion and 11% EPS growth despite softer ASV.
- Outlook balanced but conservative: Expect FY ASV at low end of 5–7% and revenue at low end; Q3 soft, Q4 better; Credit Suisse reduction included conservatively (timing uncertain).
- GenAI and TCO underpin strategy: New AI products (Mercury, Transcript Assistant, banker automation) gaining traction; TCO/C-suite conversations driving competitive displacements and enterprise opportunities.
- Managed services enable enterprise wins: Lower margin but strengthens platform-led, end-to-end workflow value proposition across front/middle/back office.
- Investment ramp near term: Tech/cloud spend to increase in H2 to support GenAI; internal GenAI efficiency gains expected to benefit FY25 (cost avoidance).

7) Other Notable Information
- Large wealth cancellation due to a client insourcing a custom non-standard workflow (strategic change); management frames as one-off.
- Regional ASV growth decelerated: Americas 5.9% (down 200 bps q/q), EMEA 5% (down 40 bps), APAC 5.6% (down 240 bps).
- Capitalized software development expected $80–85M in FY24 (amortized ~3 years); capitalization rising toward 3–4% of revenue with improved time tracking.
- Real estate footprint “right-sized”; offshore headcount mix ~68%.
- Focus client event (Miami, late April): Theme “revolution of an ecosystem” (AI/ML); showcases GenAI roadmap and solutions.
