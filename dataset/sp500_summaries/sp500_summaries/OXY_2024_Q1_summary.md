# Analysis: OXY_2024_Q1.txt

*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Occidental Petroleum (OXY)
- Period: Q1 2024
- Macro/industry context cited by management:
  - Commodity-price volatility early in the year; regional natural gas price dislocations (e.g., Waha weakness).
  - Third-party midstream outages (notably an extended pipeline outage in the eastern Gulf of Mexico) and seasonal maintenance created mix/realization noise.
  - Chemicals markets near cyclical trough; U.S. inflation and weak China construction demand pressuring PVC/caustic pricing, with a potential gradual recovery beyond 12–18 months (U.S. housing, India-led growth).
  - Regulatory: Colorado SB24 “production fee” compromise seen as manageable; provides operating certainty vs. more onerous measures.

2) Headline Financial Results
- EPS:
  - Adjusted: $0.63 per diluted share
  - Reported: $0.75 per diluted share (benefited from Andes arbitration settlement and equity gains; partially offset by derivative losses)
- Cash flow & liquidity:
  - Operating cash flow (pre-WC): >$2.4B
  - Free cash flow (pre-WC): >$700M
  - Unrestricted cash at quarter-end: ~ $1.3B
  - Q1 working capital outflow typical (semi-annual interest, property taxes, compensation payments)
- Production:
  - Q1 average: ~1.17 MMboe/d (annual low point; at midpoint of guidance despite GOM outage)
  - Q2 guidance: 1.23–1.27 MMboe/d; midpoint would be highest quarterly production in >3 years
  - Full-year total company production guidance maintained; mix shift lowers oil cut by ~100 bps due to GOM outage
- Costs:
  - U.S. LOE: $10.31/boe in Q1; guided to ~$10.10/boe in Q2 with further improvement expected in H2 as GOM normalizes
- Guidance/structural cash flow levers:
  - Midstream full-year guidance raised by $110M on strong Q1 marketing performance
  - Structural, commodity-independent cash flow uplift:
    - ~$725M/yr from OxyChem Plant Enhancement projects and lower crude transportation rates Permian-to-Gulf Coast
    - >$240M/yr incremental from higher Western Midstream (WES) distributions
    - ~$180M/yr interest savings from debt maturities repaid through 2026
    - Management also expressed confidence in ~$400M uplift from midstream contract roll-offs on better terms
  - Capex cadence: weighted to 1H (Q2 expected to be peak quarterly capex) due to U.S. onshore D&C weighting and Battleground project ramp-up

3) Management Commentary
- Operations/strategy:
  - Permian Delaware secondary benches (e.g., Bone Spring) delivering performance near Oxy’s record 2023 program average; 2023 secondary wells’ first-year volumes >30% above Delaware industry average. Share of secondary benches rising (>30% of 2024 Delaware program vs ~20% in 2023).
  - Inventory high-grading: target to add ~450 wells to < $50/bbl breakeven inventory in 2024 (90 added in Q1; ~half from Bone Spring). Extending Tier 1 runway and lowering capital intensity.
  - Rockies outperformance (DJ Basin): strong new well performance, higher uptime, and outside-operated volumes. Oman North achieved record gross daily production.
  - Cost efficiency: DJ/PRB well costs down $0.7–$1.0MM per well vs 1H23; early progress on Delaware cost reductions. Better uptime reduces base decline (Permian base decline improved by 4–5%, ~15 kbopd).
  - Electrification/ESG: first fully electric well service rig deployed in the Permian with Axis Energy Services; supports efficiency, cost savings, safety, and emissions reduction.
- Midstream:
  - Strong marketing optimization amid regional price dislocations; portfolio storage/transport optionality enables capturing upside despite upstream gas price pressure.
  - Oxy sees no takeaway constraints; maintains excess Permian oil takeaway capacity and gas flexibility to reach premium markets (e.g., California).
- OxyChem:
  - Q1 outperformance from improved PVC/vinyl chloride demand and lower ethylene costs. Outlook: modest price improvement and higher volumes in Q2; cycle likely near trough with gradual recovery beyond 12–18 months.
- Portfolio & capital allocation:
  - CrownRock Midland Basin acquisition progressing; closing expected in Q3 2024 (effective date 1/1/24). Free cash flow accretion and portfolio high-grading anticipated.
  - Divestitures of $4.5–$6.0B targeted within 18 months of close; strong inbound interest; decisions will be valuation-driven.
  - Deleveraging priority to reach ≤$15B principal debt; then resume share repurchases.
  - Low Carbon Ventures: Stratos DAC plant on schedule; multiple CDR credit offtakes signed, building diversified, commodity-detached cash flow.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Lower 48 outlook and capex:
  - Permian production to rise H1-to-H2 by ~18 kbopd while reducing rig count (avg ~21 rigs in 2024 vs ~24 in Q1). “More with less” via well performance, improved base decline, higher frac fleet utilization (+~10%), and facility front-loading.
  - Capital intensity improving YoY; facilities capex front-loaded; production uplift weighted to H2.
- Permian Delaware secondary benches/inventory:
  - Success broad-based across areas using proprietary subsurface workflows; focus on fit-for-purpose designs, spacing, sequencing, and leveraging existing facilities for strong returns.
  - Co-development vs sequencing: Delaware favors sequenced development (benefits from frac barriers and facility reuse), while Midland has more co-development.
- Midstream outlook:
  - Management confident in ~$400M uplift from contract roll-offs; midstream remains an upside diversifier. No structural takeaway constraints; volatility skewed positive given Oxy’s optionality.
- OPEX:
  - Q2 LOE improves modestly; further improvement expected in H2 as GOM fully normalizes post-outage and planned maintenance.
- Divestitures/deleveraging:
  - High inbound interest; assets screened for strategic fit and value. Commitment to achieve $4.5–$6B target and reduce principal debt to $15B, supported by organic FCF.
- OxyChem outlook:
  - Markets near bottom; recovery hinges on U.S. inflation abating and housing pickup; China remains overbuilt; export markets still challenged; longer-term demand led by India and others.
- Regulatory:
  - Colorado SB24 fee viewed as acceptable, providing certainty vs more restrictive alternatives.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on operations, cost reductions, inventory quality, and structural FCF uplift; cautious but pragmatic on chemicals cycle and regulatory backdrop.
- Forward-looking:
  - Q2 production set to be highest in over three years; full-year production guidance intact despite GOM disruption.
  - Structural >$1B annual cash flow uplift largely locked in or highly visible; further upside from midstream roll-offs.
  - Capital allocation path: close CrownRock, execute $4.5–$6B divestitures, delever to ≤$15B, then resume buybacks.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Midstream outperformance and raised guidance; Rockies and Permian beat; stable FY production despite outage. Oil cut modestly lower due to mix.

6) Takeaways
- Execution strength: Q1 delivered resilient cash flow and production at guidance midpoint despite GOM outage; Q2 production to reach multi-year high.
- Inventory and returns improving: Delaware secondary benches and Rockies performance extend Tier 1 runway and lower breakevens; capital intensity improving YoY.
- Structural FCF uplift: >$1B per year expected from OxyChem enhancements, lower crude transport rates, WES distributions, and interest savings; additional confidence in ~$400M midstream contract roll-off benefit.
- Deleveraging first, then buybacks: CrownRock expected to close in Q3; robust divestiture interest supports path to ≤$15B debt before resuming repurchases.
- Chemicals near trough: Modest Q2 improvement expected; fuller recovery seen beyond 12–18 months as inflation eases and ex-China demand (e.g., India) grows.

7) Other Notable Information
- Legal/one-off: Andes arbitration settlement gain boosted reported EPS.
- Gulf of Mexico: Extended third-party outage impacted Q1 volumes and oil cut; production restarted mid-April; additional planned maintenance in central GOM in Q2.
- International: Oman North record gross daily production; planned maintenance at Dolphin completed.
- Technology/ESG: First fully electric well service rig deployed in the Permian with Axis Energy Services.
- Low Carbon Ventures: Stratos DAC construction on schedule; multiple CDR credit agreements executed.
- Western Midstream (WES): Distribution increased >50%; Oxy expects >$240M incremental annual cash flow from WES distributions.
