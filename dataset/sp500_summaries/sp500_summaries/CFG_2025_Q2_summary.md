1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Citizens Financial Group (NYSE: CFG)
- Period: 2Q25 (June quarter)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Quarter marked by macro uncertainty (tariff headlines, market volatility) but improving tone into 2H.
  - Capital markets paused at points (tariff-related) but pipelines remain robust; pent-up M&A/sponsor demand.
  - Management assumes a 25 bp Fed cut in September for 3Q guide; continues to model a mild recession and tariff impacts in ACL scenario.
  - Office CRE issues increasingly contained; cycle peaks likely passed (nonaccruals in 3Q24; charge-offs in 1Q25).
  - Regulatory backdrop: ratings agencies still prefer higher capital until profitability normalizes and CRE is worked down; management comfortable running CET1 slightly above target range near term.

2) Headline Financial Results
- EPS: $0.92, up $0.15 QoQ (+19%).
- Net interest income (NII): +3.3% QoQ.
- Net interest margin (NIM): 2.95%, up 5 bps QoQ (benefits from non-core runoff timing, reduced swap drag, fixed asset repricing; deposit costs down 2 bps).
- Fees: +10% QoQ; record Wealth and Card; Mortgage up on MSR valuation; Capital Markets modestly higher (equity underwriting and loan syndications offset softer DCM and delayed M&A).
  - ~$30 million of M&A fees slipped to July (to be recognized in 3Q).
- Expenses: broadly flat QoQ; efficiency ratio improved to <65%; ~500 bps positive operating leverage.
- Credit:
  - Net charge-offs (NCOs): 48 bps (down from 51 bps adj. in 1Q).
  - Nonaccruals down 4% QoQ; trends improving.
  - ACL: 1.59% (slightly lower).
  - General office CRE: balances $2.7B; reserves $322M (11.8% coverage). Cumulative charge-offs plus current reserve equals ~20% of Mar-23 balance; reserve coverage eased as workouts progress.
- Balance sheet:
  - Loans (period-end): +1% QoQ; ex-non-core, +~2% (Private Bank +$1.2B to $4.9B; Commercial slight growth; Consumer growth in HELOC and mortgage). Non-core runoff ~$0.7B in 2Q.
  - Deposits (average): +1% QoQ; non-interest-bearing mix improved to 22%; interest-bearing costs -2 bps QoQ; cumulative down-beta cited at 54%. Stable retail deposits 67% of total (vs peer ~55%).
  - Capital: CET1 10.6% (PF for AOCI opt-out removal: ~9.1%, stable). Buybacks $200M at $39 avg; total 2Q capital return (incl. dividends) $385M. Repurchase authorization increased to $1.5B.
- Guidance:
  - 3Q25 (assumes 25 bp cut in Sept): NII +3–4%; NIM +~5 bps; IEAs up slightly; noninterest income up low-single-digit (cap markets rebound; mortgage/other down); expenses +1–1.5% (Private Bank build, strong fee volumes); positive operating leverage; modestly better credit; CET1 stable with ~$75M buybacks (loan growth dependent).
  - Full-year 2025: broadly in line with January outlook.
  - Medium-term: ROTC 16–18% target; NIM targets: 4Q25 3.05–3.10%; 4Q26 3.15–3.30%; 2027 3.25–3.50%.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and growth vectors:
  - Private Bank/Private Wealth: accelerating across loans, deposits, and AUM. 2Q loan growth +$1.2B; deposits 36% NIB mix; AUM $6.5B (+$1.3B). Early 3Q deposits >$9.5B; on track for >5% EPS accretion to CFG in 2025 and 20–24% ROE.
  - New York City Metro expansion, Private Capital, Payments, and Balance Sheet Optimization (BSO) progressing; BSO headwinds easing (non-core runoff moderating; commercial reductions largely complete; CRE to decline ~$0.5B/quarter in 2H).
  - Reimagining the Bank: multi-year transformation (next “TOP” program) led by Brendan Coughlin; leverages GenAI/agentic AI, operating model redesign, data/tech architecture modernization, vendor simplification, and real estate optimization. Targeting customer experience uplift and structural efficiency; more detail later this year. Current “TOP” program on track for $100M pre-tax run-rate benefit by YE.
  - Consumer/Card: launched new Mastercard suite (incl. Summit Reserve metal, annual fee) to re-position card profitability and drive cross-sell.
  - HELOC leadership: #1 national originations in recent quarters (operating in 14–15 states), high-700s FICO, mid-60s CLTV, yields >7%, deepening deposits.
  - Payments: wins in merchant acquiring and embedded finance supporting low-cost deposits.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Tariffs remain an uncertainty, though worst outcomes seem less likely; customers adapting.
  - Competitive deposit and loan markets; management committed to return discipline, not chasing price.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Loan growth outlook: Inflection across Commercial, Consumer, and Private Bank; sponsor activity and line utilization improving; expansion markets (NY Metro, Florida, California) seeing strong full-wallet wins. Non-core/BSO headwind fading.
- NIM and hedging: Confident in multi-year NIM range even under dovish scenarios (low end achievable with Fed funds ~2.75%). Using forward-starting hedges opportunistically while preserving upside if rates stay higher.
- Deposits/costs: Low-cost retail deposits outperform peers by >300 bps YTD; strong CD retention at meaningfully lower repricing rates (120–150 bps below maturities); mix improving (NIB 22%). Expect stable-to-lower deposit costs in 2H aided by CD roll-down and seasonal commercial inflows; LDR to remain healthy.
- Capital/regulation: CET1 to stay slightly above 10–10.5% target range near term; ratings agencies still cautious until profitability/CRE normalize. Conservative capital viewed as strategic advantage for opportunistic growth.
- Cap markets pipeline: Broad-based strength building—beyond refis to new-money deals; private complex activity rising; several sizable M&A closings in July (~$30M fees) with robust pipelines in M&A/DCM; ranked #3 middle-market sponsored bookrunner by deal volume in 2Q.
- Credit: Office reserve coverage reduced as losses are realized without need to rebuild; no new office moved to workout in past year; charge-offs and nonaccruals believed past peak; expect modest NCO improvement in 3Q.
- Stablecoin: Monitored under payments strategy; no near-term material spend; likely consortium/vendor approach.
- Capital allocation to cap markets: Not capital constrained; leaning in via OpEx (talent, industry specialization) rather than risk limits.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Constructive and confident on 2H; comfortable with full-year guide; optimistic on cap markets and loan demand pickup; positive on deposit cost trajectory and NIM expansion path.
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Expect continued NIM tailwinds (non-core runoff timing, swap drag reduction, fixed asset repricing).
  - Private Bank momentum to continue; on pace to YE goals; more scaling contemplated in 2026+.
  - Credit trends improving; office CRE increasingly contained; ACL may moderate if macro holds.
  - Capital returns ongoing (buybacks, dividends) with robust CET1.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Better-than-expected NII/NIM and fee growth; operating leverage ~5%.
  - ~$30M of M&A fees shifted into 3Q; “Other income” benefited from several favorable items in 2Q.

6) Takeaways
- Positive: Broad-based revenue strength (NII +3.3%, fees +10%), NIM expansion, improving deposit mix/costs, and disciplined expenses yielded strong operating leverage and EPS growth.
- Private Bank scaling: Loans, deposits (36% NIB), and AUM all advancing; on track for >5% EPS accretion in 2025 and 20–24% ROE; early 3Q deposits >$9.5B.
- Credit turning the corner: Charge-offs and nonaccruals likely past peak; office CRE reserves now absorbing losses without rebuild; ACL slightly down to 1.59%.
- Capital and capital return: CET1 10.6% (9.1% PF AOCI removal); buyback authorization raised to $1.5B; plan ~$75M repurchases in 3Q (subject to loan growth).
- Strategic transformation: “Reimagining the Bank” aims to harness AI and structural redesign for multi-year efficiency and growth; details to come later in 2025.
