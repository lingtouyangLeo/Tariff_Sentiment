3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and execution
  - Oncology momentum: Segment revenue up ~71% YoY, driven by both legacy Pfizer and Seagen portfolios.
    - Prostate: Xtandi +28% YoY; Talzenna +77%; TALAPRO-2 showed OS benefit for Talzenna + Xtandi in mCRPC (first to do so).
    - Bladder: PADCEV + Keytruda rapidly becoming U.S. 1L standard for advanced urothelial.
    - Lung: Lorbrena robust growth; BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI +32% YoY; strong 5-year data supporting 1L uptake.
    - Hem/Onc: Elrexfio (BCMA bispecific) ~80% sequential revenue growth QoQ; Japan first-to-market BCMA bispecific; four registrational studies in earlier lines ongoing.
  - Vaccines
    - Prevnar 20: U.S. market shares high (peds ~83%, adult ~97%); ACIP expansion to 50+ supports larger U.S. adult opportunity; 4th-gen PCV (25-valent with improved serotype 3) in Ph2; 5th-gen >30-valent in preclinical.
    - RSV Abrysvo: U.S. share gains; retailer/clinic sell-out share >50%; retail shots-in-arms share 43% by mid-Oct; FDA approved 18–59 at-risk label expansion; maternal uptake improving.
    - Lyme (VLA15): Ph3 underway; would be only vaccine if approved.
    - C. diff: 2nd-gen formulation in Ph2.
  - COVID portfolio
    - Paxlovid demand stabilizing; 2024 treated patients similar to 2023; strong commercial execution and access globally (reimbursed in 44 markets).
    - Next-gen oral (ibuzatrelvir): Ph2 showed robust antiviral activity without ritonavir boosting and fewer tolerability issues; Ph3 starting in coming months.
    - Comirnaty: Seasonally earlier supply in place; vaccination tracking slightly above last year due to timing; international contracts executing.
  - Immunology/Derm
    - SIBINQO: +74% QoQ operational growth globally; +27% U.S. QoQ.
    - Litfulo: Ongoing uptake in severe alopecia areata; exploring non-segmental vitiligo (Ph3).
    - Tri-specific antibodies: Early AD data promising; Ph2 in progress.
  - Neurology: Nurtec ODT TRx +28%; leading in oral CGRP; 85% of PCP first-time CGRP writers choose Nurtec.
  - Metabolic/Obesity
    - Danuglipron: Once-daily modified-release dose-optimization ongoing; update expected early 2025. Strategy emphasizes being second oral to market if timelines hold.
    - Oral GIPR antagonist entering Ph2 in 2024; second oral GLP-1 (QD) in Ph1; longer-term aim for oral-oral combinations targeting 10–20% weight loss.
  - Rare disease/cardiovascular
    - Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (tafamidis): Strong growth; global patients on treatment +40% QoQ; continued diagnosis and access expansion; management expects 2025 volume growth to moderate given competition/IRA effects.
    - Sickle cell: Oxbryta withdrawal a 2024 headwind; next-gen GBT-601 (sivellatol—next-gen HbS polymerization inhibitor) progressing with better potency/tolerability; trial execution focused on high-quality sites.
  - Cachexia: Panzegromab program delivered positive Ph2 in cancer cachexia (weight/appetite/activity/muscle mass); registration-enabling study planned in 2025; HF-related cachexia Ph2 ongoing.
- Cost/margins/capital
  - Manufacturing optimization: Phase 1 savings begin 2025; $1.5B by 2027; phases 2–3 under evaluation.
  - Deleveraging: Target gross leverage ~3.25x; YTD 2024 debt/CP reduction ~$4.4B; further Halion monetization ($3.5B in Oct; ownership now ~15%; $6.9B proceeds YTD).
  - Capital returns: Committed to maintain and grow dividend; buybacks post-deleveraging; minimal 2024 BD activity.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Obesity strategy: Aim to be #2 oral with once-daily danuglipron MR; layering oral GIPR antagonist for efficacy/tolerability; longer-term oral-oral combo could target low-teens to ~20% weight loss.
- RSV revaccination: Titers robust 1–2 years; meaningful booster likely around 3 years for most adults; annual revaccination may be physician-directed for immunocompromised/high-risk groups.
- Oncology pipeline detail:
  - ADCs: Sigvotatug vedotin (ITGB6; SGN-B6A) in Ph3; PD-L1V-ADC moving to registrational trials in 2025; disitamab vedotin (HER2-low urothelial) in registrational-intent trials; next-gen CD30 (SGN-35C) with promising data forthcoming.
  - Breast cancer: Highly selective CDK4 inhibitor moving to 1L Ph3 vs physician’s choice of CDK4/6; ER degrader vepdegestrant (with Arvinas) nearing first Ph3 readout.
  - EZH2 inhibitor (mevrometostat): Randomized Ph2 data coming; supported initiation of two Ph3s in mCRPC.
  - Breakwater (BRAF V600E mCRC 1L) readout upcoming.
- COVID durability: Paxlovid and Comirnaty businesses viewed as durable with volumes correlated to waves; U.S. Paxlovid treatment courses in 2024 tracking close to 2023; stable vaccination dynamics.
- 2025 guide/tone: Company to provide 2025 guidance by year-end 2024, including IRA/Part D impacts; noted ~$0.30 headwind vs 2024 given non-repeating items.
- Activist dialogue: Management open to ideas but confident in current plan and BD track record (Seagen, BioNTech). Evaluating asset monetization options; continued Halion sell-down.
- Abrysvo dynamics: Q3 benefited from ensuring retailer/system stocking; market share materially improved; expect continued 4Q administration volumes.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Demand: Stable-to-durable COVID utilization; strong oncology demand; tafamidis growth to moderate in 2025 amid competition.
  - Costs/margins: Continued opex discipline; manufacturing productivity to support gross margin expansion beyond 2025; operating margin ambition mid-to-high 30s over time (ex-Comirnaty mix effect).
  - Capital allocation: Continued deleveraging, dividend commitment, potential future buybacks; further Halion monetization planned; “all options on the table” for portfolio optimization.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Guidance raised on revenue and EPS; Paxlovid stronger than prior outlook; non-COVID growth of +14% operational YoY in Q3 underscores base-business health while absorbing Oxbryta impact.
  - Oncology synergy from Seagen integrating well; multiple registrational moves faster than some expected.
  - Clearer perspective on RSV revaccination cadence (multi-year for most).

6) Takeaways
- Base business is accelerating: Non-COVID revenue +14% operational and multiple new product launches executing well; 2024 revenue/EPS guidance raised.
- COVID normalizing to durable: Utilization patterns for Paxlovid and Comirnaty stabilizing vs 2023; next-gen oral antiviral advancing to Ph3 to extend the franchise.
- Oncology is the growth engine: Strong commercial momentum and a deep ADC/CDK4/ER degrader pipeline; Seagen integration on track with multiple Phase 3 starts/expansions.
- Margin and cash discipline: Cost programs (≥$4B opex, $1.5B mfg savings by 2027) and deleveraging progressing; dividend secure; buybacks possible post-deleveraging.
- 2025 watch items: IRA/Part D headwinds, loss of Halion equity income, non-repeat COVID accounting items, tafamidis competition; full guidance by year-end 2024.
