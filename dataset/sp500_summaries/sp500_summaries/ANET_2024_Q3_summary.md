  - Multi-year: double-digit growth; FY24–26 revenue CAGR mid-teens
  - TAM: expected to expand to ~$70B by 2028

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/Initiatives:
  - “Arista 2.0”: data-driven networking across data center, campus, WAN, and AI centers; leveraging EOS, CloudVision, telemetry/automation, and AI-driven AIOps (AVA).
  - AI Networking Portfolio: EtherLink 800G platforms for scale-out Ethernet AI fabrics; 7060X6 AI leaf, 7800R4 AI spine in production; new EtherLink 7700 DES (developed with Meta) provides two-tier architectures with single-stage forwarding for up to ~10k-GPU clusters.
  - Frontend-backend integration: strong demand for frontend/backbone upgrades to interconnect new AI clusters and datasets; continued demand for 7800R3 400G.
- Product/technology:
  - 800G ready; majority of 2024 AI trials remain 400G; mix shifts more to 800G through 2025 as ecosystem (NICs, optics, UEC) matures.
  - EOS capabilities: congestion control, cluster load balancing, hitless upgrades, deep visibility down to host/NIC-level (agnostic to accelerator vendors).
- Operations/Supply chain:
  - Increasing advanced silicon purchase commitments and inventory to reduce lead times and support rapid AI deployments.
  - Continued “supply chain hygiene” supporting margins and delivery.
- 2025 revenue mix:
  - Backend AI (~$750M) on track; campus (~$750M) on track; frontend AI networking can range from 0.3x to 2.0x of backend depending on workload—management assuming ~1.0x on average for ~$1.5B total AI-center networking in 2025.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Growth mix and guidance:
  - Outside AI and campus, legacy data center/cloud growth could be slower in 2025 as customers pivot to AI; visibility remains ~6 months; upside possible.
- AI trials update (now 5 of 5):
  - Three customers progressing from pilots to large production in 2025 (50–100k GPU clusters each).
  - Fourth: new Ethernet trial in 2024 at historically InfiniBand-centric customer; production expected 2025/26.
  - Fifth: slower due to GPU availability, power/cooling constraints; possible pickup in 2H25.
- Competition:
  - NVIDIA: key partner (GPUs); limited direct Ethernet switching overlap encountered; Arista confident in Ethernet leadership; back end still largely bundled IB today.
  - Versus Cisco/Juniper/Nokia: strong AI frontend leadership (scale L2/L3/VXLAN, visibility, automation); backend share viewed as incremental vs. IB incumbency.
  - White box: not highlighted as a significant constraint to AI opportunity.
- Campus:
  - Strength in universal spine and wired; Wi-Fi is comparatively weaker but improving; vertical traction in financials, healthcare, media, retail, Federal/SLED.
- Margins:
  - 2025 GM decline to 60–62% primarily mix-driven (more cloud/AI); Op margin 43–44% as investment continues.
  - 10%+ customers: Microsoft and Meta likely remain; adding more is harder as revenue base grows.
- Deferred revenue:
  - Product deferred increased materially; reflects trials, acceptance clauses, new product/customer mix; recognition timelines can be multi-year, not solely 2025.
- 400G vs. 800G:
  - 2024 mostly 400G; 2025 to see a more balanced mix as ecosystem readiness improves.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Confidence:
  - Strong AI traction; Ethernet ascendant for AI fabrics; broad product portfolio and software differentiation.
  - Reiterated mid-teens CAGR through 2026; 4-for-1 split signals confidence and aims to broaden investor base.
- Caution:
  - Limited visibility beyond ~6 months; backend-to-frontend realization timing varies; some large customers facing GPU/power constraints.
  - Margin pressure from customer/product mix as AI/cloud weighting rises.
- Capital allocation:
  - Ongoing buybacks ($1B remaining); increasing inventory to meet AI demand; capex for facilities expansion in Santa Clara (~$15M in Q4).

6) Takeaways
- Beat and raise: Q3 revenue/EPS beat with robust services mix; Q4 guide implies continued growth with modest GM moderation.
- 2025 pivot to AI mix: Revenue guided +15–17% to ~$8B with higher cloud/AI weighting; GM 60–62%, OM 43–44%.
- AI pipeline real: 3 of top 5 AI customers moving to large-scale production in 2025; backend AI ~$750M and campus ~$750M targets reaffirmed; total AI-center networking ~ $1.5B.
- Product leadership: Expanding 800G EtherLink portfolio (7060X6, 7800R4, new 7700 DES with Meta); strong frontend differentiation; backend gains are incremental vs. IB incumbents.
- Watch items: Deferred revenue surge tied to trials/acceptance (recognition can be multi-year), inventory build for AI, Wi‑Fi execution in campus, and backend-to-frontend conversion pace as the 800G ecosystem matures.
