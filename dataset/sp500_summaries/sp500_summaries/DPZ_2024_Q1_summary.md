---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ)
- Period: Fiscal Q1 2024
- Context/industry: 
  - U.S. QSR traffic is challenging; industry-wide pricing has pressured demand. Domino’s “smart pricing” largely completed in 2022 (minimal in 2023), positioning value favorably in 2024.
  - Labor availability is adequate; wage pressure exists (notably CA AB1228) and is being addressed with targeted pricing.
  - Third-party delivery (Uber Eats) is increasingly promotional and skewed to single-user occasions; Domino’s keeps best value on its own channels.
  - International softness persists in Europe and the Middle East; Middle East <3% of operating income.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Global retail sales: +7.3% ex-FX
  - U.S. retail sales: +7.8%
  - International retail sales: +6.8% ex-FX
- Same-store sales (U.S.): +5.6%
  - Carryout +9.5%; Delivery +2.9%
  - Drivers: Primarily transactions; ~0.9% pricing contribution; ~1.4% sales mix from Uber; mix headwind from higher carryout.
- International SSS: +0.9% ex-FX
- Income from operations: +19.4% ex-FX; supply chain margin benefited from procurement productivity, lower food basket, slightly lower delivery costs; margin rate aided ~30 bps by tech fee ($0.395) and lower ad fund rate (5.75%).
- Unit growth: U.S. +20 net (to 6,874); International +144 net (vs +106 in Q1’23).
- U.S. franchisee profitability: On track for ~$170k average store profit in 2024.
- EPS/Revenue: Not provided in the call remarks; refer to 8-K for GAAP/non-GAAP details.
- Guidance/outlook reiterated:
  - ≥7% global retail sales growth ex-FX
  - U.S. comps 3%+ in each remaining quarter; Q2 slightly below Q1 as Emergency Pizza rolls off, partially offset by Uber ramp
  - Uber Eats sales mix to exit 2024 at 3%+ (Q1 ~1.4%)
  - International comps soft 1H, re-accelerate to ~3%+ in 2H
  - Net unit adds: ≥1,100 (175 U.S., 925 International)
  - Operating income growth: ≥8% ex-FX; operating margin roughly flat y/y
  - G&A ~2.4% of retail sales; +$9m timing in Q2 for Worldwide Rally
  - Supply chain margins roughly flat; food basket inflation 1–3% for the year (modest leverage if at low end).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy (Hungry for MORE):
  - M – Most Delicious Food: Upgraded food creative; pan pizza campaign; launched New York Style Pizza (thinner, foldable crust, provolone blend), a permanent menu addition included in Mix & Match and redeemable at 60 points.
  - O – Operational Excellence: “More Delicious Operations” (three training sprints: dough, ingredients, baking). Q1 dough sprint completed across all U.S. stores; delivered more orders y/y with improved delivery times.
  - R – Renowned Value: Emergency Pizza (outperformed any prior BOGO), “You Tip, We Tip,” and revived Carryout Boost Weeks (~6 planned in 2024) to profitably acquire and engage customers.
  - E – Exceptional Franchisees: Worldwide Rally in May to align global system on execution of the strategy.
- Loyalty relaunch: Lowered earn threshold to $5; added 20/40-point redemptions (now majority of redemptions). Strong growth in active members, notably new/lapsed/light users and carryout customers. Loyalty is driving transaction growth and incremental franchisee profit dollars.
- Aggregators (Uber Eats): Channel is more promotional; Domino’s optimizing base price/discount mix and marketing. Incrementality ~two-thirds; higher single-user mix; best values remain on Domino’s channels.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Comps sustainability: 3%+ is the floor; repeatable drivers (product news, ops, renowned value, loyalty). Q2 comps to be slightly below Q1 due to Emergency Pizza roll-off; Uber ramps through the year.
- Margins: Q1 expansion slightly above plan due to delayed supply-chain investments (now weighted to Q2–Q4). Full-year margin still roughly flat; procurement productivity and 1–3% food inflation embedded.
- Traffic vs price: Q1 comp acceleration was largely transaction-driven across delivery and carryout; loyalty tailwind expected to persist into 2025.
- Promotions: 3P is high/low. Domino’s emphasizes “renowned value” (concept-led offers) versus pure discounts; targeting profit dollar growth (franchisee profits on track to ~$170k/store).
- Labor: Access healthy; wage inflation addressed locally (e.g., high single-digit pricing in CA). Delivery speeds improved while order volumes increased.
- International: Europe/Middle East remain pressured; expect back-half improvement as markets adopt the MORE playbook (e.g., Mexico +12.2% Q1; Australia “More” campaign).
- Delivery fees: Franchisee-set and benchmarked to local competition; focus remains on total landed value and best pricing on owned channels.
- Store growth: Pipeline supports 175+ U.S. net adds in 2024; unit growth is a lagging indicator of strengthening unit economics.
- Advertising: Heavier emphasis on food and value creative; stronger breakthrough without materially higher activity.
- Operations: Next sprints on ingredients and baking; aim is product consistency and repeat purchase.
- Dayparts/menu: Best results from “pizza-plus” (full menu) rather than chasing lunch or non-pizza standalone; 3P introduces single-serve users who can be converted to Domino’s ecosystem.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand: Broad-based U.S. order growth across income cohorts, strongest at lower income due to value; carryout robust; loyalty disperses activity across the quarter, not just promo spikes.
- Costs: Food basket inflation 1–3%; procurement tailwinds continue; supply-chain investments and Q2 G&A step-up will temper margin leverage; localized wage pressure manageable.
- Aggregators: More promotional than expected but incrementality and sales mix track to plan; optimization underway.
- Surprise elements: Q1 margin expansion a bit ahead of plan (timing of investments); Boost Week outperformed; Uber more promotional but manageable; comps largely transaction-led.

6) Takeaways
- U.S. momentum is real and repeatable: Transaction-led comps driven by loyalty relaunch, compelling value, and better operations.
- Margin outlook disciplined: Q1 benefited from timing; full-year margins roughly flat as investment resumes, with potential modest leverage if food inflation sits at the low end.
- Uber partnership on track: Mix rose to ~1.4% in Q1; targeting 3%+ exit; ~two-thirds incremental, albeit more promotional.
- International to improve in 2H: Current pressures in Europe/Middle East offset by adoption of the MORE playbook and solid unit growth.
- 2024 guide intact: ≥7% global retail sales growth ex-FX, ≥1,100 net stores, ≥8% operating income growth, and ~$170k U.S. franchisee store profit target.

7) Other Notable Information
- Ad fund contribution rate (5.75%) and tech fee ($0.395) added ~30 bps to Q1 margin rate.
- Worldwide Rally (May) adds ~$9m to Q2 G&A; key forum to scale best practices globally.
- New York Style Pizza is a permanent addition (M/L/XL), included in Mix & Match and rewards; designed to attract different crust-preference occasions.
- Emergency Pizza cited as the best-performing BOGO-style mechanic in management’s experience; meaningful driver in Q4’23 and Q1’24.
- Operational training reframed around “one pizza made 1.5 million times per day” to drive consistency and repeat purchase.
