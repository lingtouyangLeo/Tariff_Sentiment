3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/Innovation:
  - “Only Equifax” solutions now live: combined TWN employment/income + USIS mortgage credit file for shopping/pre-qual; strong early demand. Auto and personal loan versions planned later in 2025.
  - Vitality index 11% (100 bps above long-term 10% goal); innovation expected to accelerate through 2025–2026.
  - EFX.ai + Ignite analytics leveraging single data fabric to build multi-data solutions (traditional + alternative credit and TWN).
- EWS/Government:
  - SSA amendment signed; ~+$50M annual run-rate to support monthly income/employment data for disability applicants/recipients; ramps across quarters.
  - Expanding presence in D.C. and states; focus areas include Do Not Pay and IRS EITC use cases; state penetration remains the largest opportunity.
  - TWIN database growth: +3M active records QoQ; 191M active (+11% YoY), 751M total (+12%); 4.4M companies contributing; 138M unique individuals; 3 new partners in Q1 (15 in 2024; 50+ since 2021).
- USIS:
  - Strong non-mortgage B2B online growth in FI (mid-single-digit) and auto (high-single-digit); offline (FMS) +10% on modernization and stronger delivery via cloud.
  - Clear post-cloud commercial momentum, share gains targeted; operational benefits from decommissioned legacy systems.
- International:
  - Broad-based growth; strongest in LatAm (Brazil/Argentina) and APAC; Spain transformation complete; Canada/Europe softer macro.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Government opportunity:
  - Strong policy momentum on reducing ~$160B of improper payments; SSA amendment a proof point; state-level adoption a key runway. Expect ~10% government growth in H2.
- Recession framework:
  - 67% of revenue now recession-resilient/counter-cyclical (vs 54% in 2022; 37% in 2008).
  - In a “typical” recession (GDP -300 bps; LT rates -150 bps in back half), Equifax believes total revenue could still grow 5–10% over the cycle; non-mortgage low-single-digit growth; mortgage could rebound strongly if rates fall.
  - Subscription mix is rising; more data used in weaker macro (e.g., TWN and alternative data).
- Mortgage visibility:
  - Recent weakening as rates rose in late March/April; Q2 and FY mortgage inquiry guides reflect current run rates.
- Talent/Hiring:
  - Q1 beat from execution and modestly better volumes in Feb–Mar; Q2 low-single-digit growth expected; full-year assumption unchanged (weaker hiring; prior commentary suggested ~8% decline).
- FCF seasonality:
  - Q1 conversion low due to larger bonus payouts; full-year ~$900M intact.
- Competitive landscape:
  - TrueWork’s sale to Checkr seen as immaterial; TWN scale and automation remain differentiators.
- Margins:
  - EWS margins >50% despite mortgage drag; USIS margins improving on cloud decommissioning and growth; non-mortgage margins higher than mortgage (vendor payment mix).
- Capital allocation:
  - Confidence supported by leverage at 2.5x, lower capex run-rate, resilient FCF. Balanced approach across capex, bolt-on M&A, dividend, and buybacks.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Cautious stance: maintaining FY guide despite Q1 beat due to macro uncertainty (tariffs/inflation/rates).
  - Confident signals: 28% dividend increase (to $0.50) and new $3B, 4-year buyback; intent to return ~$1B/year to shareholders on average over 4 years, increasing with FCF growth and mortgage recovery.
  - Demand trends: Non-mortgage stable; auto/cards healthy; slight stress in subprime; Canada/UK a bit softer; U.S. employment still supportive.
  - Cost outlook: Structural margin benefits from cloud completion; optionality to tighten costs if macro worsens.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Beat on revenue/EPS, broad-based non-mortgage strength, better-than-expected mortgage on pre-qual products and rates dip, EWS margins >50%, SSA amendment, sizable capital return program.

6) Takeaways
- Strong start to 2025: Revenue, EPS, and margins exceeded guidance with broad-based non-mortgage strength and mortgage outperformance on product mix and pricing pass-through.
- Guidance held despite beat: Reflects management caution amid macro uncertainty; mortgage inquiry decline for FY unchanged at -12%.
- Government tailwinds building: SSA amendment (~$50M), policy focus on improper payments, accelerating state penetration—supports H2 government growth (~10%).
- Post-cloud benefits visible: USIS accelerating growth and margin expansion; innovation pipeline (EFX.ai, combined TWN + credit solutions) gaining traction.
- Shareholder returns stepped up: Dividend up 28%; new $3B buyback; ~95% FCF conversion and 2.5x leverage underpin balanced capital allocation.
