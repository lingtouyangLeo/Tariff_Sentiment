Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)
- Period: Fiscal Q1 2025 (12 weeks ended November 24, 2024)
- Context:
  - Consumer is “choiceful”; ongoing bifurcation between premium and value purchases; some shift from food-away-from-home to food-at-home.
  - Overall merchandise inflation essentially flat (slight inflation in food/fresh, deflation in non-foods).
  - Gasoline price deflation (avg price per gallon down low double digits) pressured gas sales/mix.
  - Supply chain: shipping still less predictable than pre-COVID; items spend longer on water. Monitoring potential port strikes (India, U.S. East Coast, Canada). Avian flu impacted egg supply; East Coast port strikes spiked paper/water demand. Inventory positioned well for holidays.
  - Pharmacy industry disruption is a tailwind for Costco’s pharmacy.
  - Labor: Ongoing Teamsters negotiations; company reiterates 40-year track record of fair dealings.
  - Tariffs: Uncertain timing/scope; generally cost-raising; Costco has mitigation playbook.
  - Sustainability report updated; shareholder meeting in January.

- Net income: $1.798B; Diluted EPS: $4.04 (includes $0.22 discrete tax benefit) vs. $3.58 last year (includes $0.10 benefit).
  - Ex-discrete tax items: net income +9.9%, EPS +9.8% YoY; underlying tax rate would have been 26.5% (reported 22%).

  - E-commerce: +13.0% / +13.2%

- Membership fee income: $1.166B, +7.8% YoY; recent fee increase contributed <1% of growth due to deferred accounting.
  - Renewal rates: U.S./Canada 92.8% (down 10 bps QoQ); Worldwide 90.4% (down 10 bps), pressured by greater mix of digital signups (renew slightly lower).
  - Members: 77.4M paid households (+7.6% YoY); 138.8M cardholders (+7.2%); 36.4M paid Executive (+9.2%) representing 46.8% of paid members and 73.1% of sales.

  - Ancillary/other margins: -12 bps (-16 bps ex-gas), driven by gas; e-commerce margin improved similarly to last quarter.
  - 2% Executive reward: +5 bps benefit (+6 bps ex-gas), largely a Q1 true-up of accruals.
  - LIFO: $19M credit (vs. $15M).
  - SG&A rate: 9.59% vs. 9.45%, +14 bps YoY; flat ex-gas. Higher wages (July) were the main headwind; partially offset by leverage/productivity. Central +5 bps; stock comp -2 bps; pre-opening -4 bps.
  - Interest expense: $37M (vs. $38M); interest income: $96M (vs. $154M) due to lower cash balances after Jan-2024 special dividend and lower rates; headwind continues in Q2. FX/other gain $51M (vs. $6M).
- Capex: $1.26B in Q1; FY25 outlook ≈ $5B.
- Openings: 7 warehouses opened in Q1 (1 relocation) = +6 net; 897th warehouse opened post-quarter in Pleasanton, CA (record U.S. opening-day sales of $2.9M). FY25 plan: 29 openings (3 relocations) = 26 net; 10 international.
- Guidance: No formal EPS/revenue guidance. December (5-week) sales to be reported Jan 8, 2025.

Management Commentary
- Growth/expansion:
  - Expect roughly 25–30 annual openings for next few years; significant share outside the U.S.; strong U.S. runway both in new markets and decongesting high-volume clubs (incremental and faster build-backs).
  - Continued investments in depots/logistics and technology modernization.
- Merchandising:
  - Fresh led comps (meat double-digit); food & sundries mid-single-digit (cooler/frozen strong); non-foods high single-digit despite calendar shift—double-digit growth in gold jewelry, gift cards, home furnishings, sporting goods, health & beauty aids, luggage, kiosk, hardware.
  - New brands added: Peloton, Wrangler, Springfree Trampolines, Ruggable.
  - Kirkland Signature penetration ~33% in U.S., growing faster than total; price cuts on select KS items (e.g., organic peanut butter, chicken stock, Sauvignon Blanc); new KS Oxy Powder and Food Storage Bags.
- Digital/E-commerce:
  - App enhancements (e.g., check warehouse inventory); 2.9M downloads in Q1 (≈42M cumulative).
  - E-comm traffic, conversion, AOV up; bullion meaningful tailwind; hardware, sporting goods, gift cards, home furnishings up double digits.
  - Costco Logistics: nearly 1M deliveries in Q1; record 196k deliveries in a single week; majority of big-and-bulky delivered within 4 days.
  - Costco Next (curated, member-only marketplace): record holiday-period sales.
  - Partnerships: Instacart and Uber delivery increase frequency, provide incremental sales, and improve speed/cost for small non-food deliveries.
  - E-comm penetration: 7–8% on Costco’s reported basis; >10% if adding 3P and excluding gas.
- Retail media:
  - Early innings; first offsite campaign via third-party media channels produced 2–3x typical ROAS; working with 25+ suppliers; viewed as incremental and funded from supplier marketing budgets.
- Labor/culture: Wage investments persist; focus on productivity; committed to timely, fair union agreements.

Q&A Highlights
- Consumer health: “Choiceful” spending; premium and value both strong; seasonal sell-through strong despite shorter post-Thanksgiving calendar.
- Items per basket: Positive ex-gas/FX (~+2% U.S./WW).
- Margin drivers: Stable core-on-core (+3 bps); e-comm margin improvement; gas margins lapped prior-year volatility; co-brand credit card and mix favorable.
- Price investments: Ongoing, often led by Kirkland; may hold prices even as commodities rise.
- Membership renewals: Dip driven by higher mix of digital signups (and fewer Executive signups online); underlying cohort health remains strong.
- Retail media & MVM: Media seen as incremental; working via agencies; complementary to existing marketing (e.g., multi-vendor mailers).
- Capex: No major change; steady pace of clubs, depots, tech.
- Expansion runway: U.S. capacity supported by “decompression” of existing high-volume clubs and new geographies; international opportunity across Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia.
- Competition/format: Costco views itself as its main competitor; pharmacy disruption a tailwind. No Scan & Go planned; focus on self-checkout and throughput tech; monitoring member experience.
- Precious metals/gift cards: Drive traffic and cross-sell; low SG&A supports e-comm leverage; not offset by extracting higher margins elsewhere.
- 2% reward: Q1 favorability was a true-up of accruals.
- Tariffs: Mitigation via early buys, vendor work, alternative sourcing, SKU substitution; imported non-foods are a minority of total sales.
- Stock split: No current plan; under evaluation with board.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on demand, traffic, and category breadth; vigilant on supply chain risks and interest income headwinds.
- Demand outlook: Strong pharmacy, fresh, and selective discretionary; e-comm/logistics momentum; membership growth healthy though reported renewals may stay slightly pressured by mix through FY25.
- Cost outlook: Wage investments continue; overall merchandise inflation flat; gas price deflation persists; interest income down again in Q2.
- Capital allocation: Capex ~ $5B; 26 net new clubs planned; ongoing tech/logistics investments. No new commentary on dividends/buybacks beyond prior special dividend effect on cash.

Takeaways
- Traffic-driven quarter with healthy comps (+7.1% ex-gas/FX) and robust e-commerce (+13%) as Costco Logistics and curated assortments (incl. bullion) accelerate digital.
- Gross margin expanded despite gas headwinds; core-on-core up slightly; SG&A rate higher on wages but largely offset by leverage/productivity.
- Membership engine solid: fee income +7.8%; slight renewal-rate dip is mix-driven; Executive penetration rising to 73% of sales supports loyalty and basket.
- Expansion and moat building intact: 26 net FY25 clubs; strong U.S. and international runway; tech/logistics modernization advancing service levels.
- Watch items: Interest income headwind in Q2; potential port/tariff risks; reported renewal rates likely to remain modestly pressured in FY25 due to digital mix.
