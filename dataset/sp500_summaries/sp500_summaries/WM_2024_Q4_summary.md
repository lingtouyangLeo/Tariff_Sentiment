1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: WM (Waste Management, Inc.), ticker: WM
- Period: Q4 and full year 2024; call date: January 30, 2025
- Context and industry backdrop:
  - Solid momentum in core collection and disposal; MSW landfill volumes strong, special waste pipeline strengthening; industrial roll-off remains soft
  - Labor market still tight; wage inflation expected at 4–5% in 2025; overall CPI moderating
  - California wildfires impacted communities served; WM operations intact and positioned to support cleanup
  - Renewable energy and recycling growth investments scaling; RNG project interconnects and permitting improving
  - Policy/tax: ITC benefits under IRA expected to remain; expiration of alternative fuel (CNG) tax credit is a 2025 headwind

2) Headline Financial Results
- Profitability and margins (2024):
  - Operating EBITDA margin reached 30% for the first time in company history
  - Collection & Disposal (C&D) operating EBITDA margin: 37.2% for 2024, up 200 bps YoY
  - Operating expenses at 60.3% of revenue in Q4; full-year 60.7%, down 100 bps YoY
  - SG&A: 9.6% of revenue for 2024 (includes ~30 bps headwind from WM Healthcare Solutions); legacy WM SG&A improved ~10 bps YoY
- Cash flow (2024):
  - Cash from operations: $5.39B (+14% YoY)
  - FCF before sustainability growth investments: $3.27B (+22.5% YoY)
- 2025 guidance (midpoints unless noted):
  - Total company operating EBITDA growth: ~15% (~$1B YoY increase)
  - C&D operating EBITDA growth: >7% despite a $63M alternative fuel tax credit headwind (~30 bps margin headwind)
  - Price/mix/volume:
    - Core price: 5.8–6.2%
    - Yield: 4.0–4.2% (lower conversion due to landfill mix)
    - C&D volume: +0.25% to +0.75%
  - Sustainability growth contribution: ~$190M incremental EBITDA in 2025 (~$150M shown in sustainability segments; remainder flows to C&D via royalties/fees)
  - Capex: $3.175–$3.275B (incl. ~$625M sustainability growth, ~$225M WM Healthcare Solutions)
  - FCF: ~$2.725B; includes ~$220M of ITC benefit
  - Capital allocation: ~$1.3B dividends; $100–$200M tuck-in M&A; share repurchases paused; year-end 2025 leverage target ~3.1x (LT target 2.5–3.0x)

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and execution:
  - Core business is the “superstar”: disciplined pricing, cost takeout, network optimization (internalization >70%), and improved labor efficiency
  - Residential optimization: automated >500 routes, exited ~400 unprofitable routes; residential EBITDA margin up >400 bps, approaching 20%; expect continued intentional shedding (down ~3–3.5% volume annually) into 2025–26
  - Sustainability investments: 5 RNG plants online in 2024; eight more to come online in 2025; significant recycling automation across network; strong customer traction from improved product quality and throughput
- WM Healthcare Solutions (Stericycle) integration:
  - Integration of commercial, ops support, and back office largely completed; cultural and operational changes underway
  - Synergies increased to $250M over three years (from prior ~$125M), with up to $100M in 2025 (assumes $85–$90M at midpoint)
  - Focus areas: internalization, SG&A and OPEX takeout (sales coverage optimization, facility consolidation, fleet reduction, insourcing maintenance/repair)
  - ERP remediation emphasizing process, data, and change management; ~($35–$40)M 2025 ERP investment expected; potential working capital/DSO cash improvement of ~$150M by early 2026
- RNG and recycling:
  - RNG returns tracking prior targets; capex higher, but ~3-year payback still intact (pre-ITC); EBITDA flow-through ~75%
  - Electricity is largest RNG operating cost; active efforts to reduce power consumption and lock long-term rates
  - RIN strategy: ~50% of 2025 projected sales locked (mix of voluntary and D3 RINs; some 2025 RINs presold at ~$2.70); aiming for rolling hedge ladder (e.g., 80/40/20 concept over time)
  - Recycling commodity price assumption: ~$85/ton in 2025 (vs. ~$92 in 2024); fee-for-service model and automation reduce earnings sensitivity to commodity prices

4) Q&A Highlights
- Pricing/yield:
  - Yield conversion lower due to higher landfill mix, which carries lower unit rate but strong profitability
  - Expect positive price-to-cost spread in 2025; continued productivity and OPEX improvements
- Stericycle/WM Healthcare Solutions:
  - WM recast EBITDA definition to exclude adjustments they consider normal course; 2024 WMHS base EBITDA run-rate ~ $350M (WM definition); 2025 WMHS EBITDA around ~$460M including ~9% organic EBITDA growth (pre-synergies) plus ~$85–$90M synergies
  - Minimal cross-sell assumed for 2025; cross-sell expected to ramp in 2026; large long-term opportunity
  - Targeting SG&A ratio down meaningfully (longer-term aiming toward WM’s <10%, with an intermediate step around ~15%)
- Volumes/mix:
  - MSW landfill +4.4% in 2024; special waste pipeline strong into 2025; industrial remains soft, no material rebound assumed
  - Residential shedding to continue; process is to reprice at acceptable margins upon contract renewal and accept attrition as needed
- Sustainability cadence:
  - RNG 2025 contributions back-half-weighted (plant timing); recycling more even due to rollover of 2024 automation and fewer shutdown costs in 2025
  - 2025 recycling commodity headwind more pronounced in H1; improvement expected later in year
- Tax and interest:
  - 2025 cash interest +$350–$400M YoY (about $300M from acquisition); cash taxes +$75–$100M YoY due to higher ITCs offsetting higher pre-tax income

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on core execution, synergy capture, and sustainability growth; cautious on industrial demand; disciplined on capital allocation and leverage
- Forward-looking signals:
  - Strong price discipline and cost control continue; labor turnover at record low supports stability
  - Sustainability EBITDA accelerating; RNG buildout mostly constructed by end of 2025 (all but two plants), supporting 2026 visibility
  - WMHS synergies raised meaningfully; ERP and process work to unlock 2026 step-change (including cash conversion)
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Doubling of Stericycle synergy target to $250M
  - 2025 operating EBITDA growth guide of ~15% (~$1B) and clear bridge by segment
  - First-ever 30% operating EBITDA margin year; internalization >70%

6) Takeaways
- Core engine outperforming: Record C&D margin (37.2%) and sustained price-to-cost spread with continued operational efficiency, logistics, and route automation gains.
- Stericycle integration on track and better: Synergies now $250M over three years; ~$85–$90M in 2025, minimal cross-sell assumed (2026 opportunity), ERP/process work to improve growth and cash conversion.
- Sustainability scaling: ~$190M incremental EBITDA in 2025 from RNG/recycling investments; RNG hedge posture prudent; power cost focus; recycling resilience via automation and fee-for-service model.
- 2025 growth and cash: Operating EBITDA +~15%; FCF ~$2.7B including ~$220M ITC; deleveraging to ~3.1x; dividends maintained; buybacks paused.
- Risks/unknowns: Industrial end-market recovery uncertain; commodity pricing variability (recycling, RINs) managed but persistent; RNG opex (electricity) in focus; execution on WMHS ERP and synergy ramp critical.

7) Other Notable Information
- Tax credits:
  - 2025 headwind: Alternative fuel (CNG) tax credit expiration is a ~$63M EBIT/EBITDA headwind (~30 bps margin)
  - ITC: 2025 expected benefit ~$220M; 2024 captured ~$135M; domestic content emphasis raises total ITC above prior $250–$350M range; no changes anticipated under new administration
  - Bonus depreciation not assumed; potential upside if reinstated
- Disaster work: California wildfire response expected; minimal to no contribution embedded in 2025 guide; these events typically represent episodic upside but are not forecastable
- Labor metrics: Annualized driver turnover at 15% (record low); ongoing automation reduces labor dependency, improves safety and service
- Investor events: WM Phoenix Open sponsorship noted; Investor Day planned for June with more detail on WMHS trajectory and synergy/cross-sell outlook
