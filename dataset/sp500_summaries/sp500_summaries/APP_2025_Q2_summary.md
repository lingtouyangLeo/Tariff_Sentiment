1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AppLovin (Ticker: APP)
- Period: Q2 FY2025 (quarter ended June 30, 2025)
- Context/industry backdrop:
  - Strong demand in gaming advertising; MAX Marketplace supply growing at consistent double-digit rates, outpacing in-app purchase market growth.
  - App business divested to TripleDot (closed at Q2-end); focus is now solely on advertising.
  - Expansion beyond gaming accelerating with Axon self-serve platform aimed at web/e-commerce and broader categories.
  - Web campaigns expanding internationally on Oct 1, 2025; broader public launch of Axon in 1H26.
  - Apple vs. Epic ecosystem changes seen as a medium-term tailwind to UA economics, but timing uncertain (2–8 quarters).

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q2 2025 (Advertising business):
  - Revenue: ~$1.26B, up 77% YoY.
  - Adjusted EBITDA: ~$1.02B; margin 81%.
  - Free Cash Flow: $768M, up 72% YoY (slightly lower QoQ due to semiannual bond interest and prior-year tax timing).
  - Cash & equivalents: $1.2B (includes $425M net from apps divestiture).
  - Shareholder returns: Repurchased/withheld ~0.9M shares for $341M; diluted shares down to 342M from 346M in Q4.
- Guidance (Q3 2025, Advertising business):
  - Revenue: $1.32B–$1.34B.
  - Adjusted EBITDA margin: ~81%.
  - Note: Management verbally cited Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7B–$1.9B; this appears inconsistent with guided revenue and margin. At 81% margin, implied EBITDA would be ~ $1.07B–$1.09B. Flag as likely typographical error.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and product:
  - Launching Axon Ads Manager (self-serve) as foundation for the next decade:
    - Direct control for advertisers; credit card billing; agentic workflow architecture; auto-generated ads; Shopify app integration; deeper attribution-provider integrations; dynamic product ads live.
    - Referral-based opening Oct 1, 2025 (perfectly timed for holiday season). Global public launch targeted 1H26 under the Axon brand.
    - International expansion: Web campaigns moving beyond U.S. to most major international markets on Oct 1.
  - Monetization approach: Once fully open in 2026, plan to performance-market Axon to recruit SMBs globally (lean model; avoid large salesforce).
  - Core gaming: Continued tech-driven gains and supply expansion via MAX; management confident gaming alone can support 20–30% YoY growth.
- Portfolio:
  - Sale of apps portfolio closed; strategic focus on ad tech.
- Capital allocation:
  - Priorities: invest organically (engineering/BD), then return capital via buybacks.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Paid marketing for advertiser acquisition:
  - Rationale: Enormous TAM and small current advertiser base; strong unit economics expected (LTV/CAC) with automated onboarding; will test channels (own inventory, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok) but scale spend only if cash-accretive.
- Supply growth drivers:
  - Less about mediation share gains (MAX already high penetration); more about users playing more games, rising ad loads, and tech-driven CPMs; AppLovin benefits both from MAX fees and its own DSP wins.
- Self-serve impact and e-commerce mix:
  - E-comm roughly ~10% of 2025 revenue so far; onboarding intentionally constrained in Q2–Q3 to build tools (Ads Manager, DPA, MMP integrations, Shopify app). Expect a material Q4 ramp from existing cohort plus referral-based onboarding and international opening.
- Modeling/AI:
  - Two Axon models: distinct architectures for gaming vs. web; efficacy parity timing unknown but data flywheel from non-gaming should also benefit gaming.
  - Automation-first philosophy: Minimize manual targeting; move toward AI-driven workflows. Some desired “Meta-like” targeting features (e.g., customer exclusion) are structurally different on AppLovin inventory, but performance is strong despite feature gaps.
- Referral mechanics and expenses:
  - Will iterate; leaning toward organic referrals without paid bounties; any referral cost would be immaterial to margins. Expect rapid advertiser count growth.
- Guidance cadence:
  - Q3 guide includes incremental uplift from apps divestiture economics.
- International and new supply:
  - Expect broader advertiser base geographically; will consider plugging into non-gaming supply (social, music, news, sports, web) over time to access users beyond games.
- Apple vs. Epic:
  - No visible impact yet; expect large publishers to move gradually; potential pricing tailwind in 2–8 quarters.
- Margins:
  - Incremental margins remain high; sales/marketing for Axon acquisition will show in S&M line but only scaled if returns are strong.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and disciplined; clear path to expand TAM materially with Axon while gaming continues to outperform industry growth.
- Demand trends: Strong gaming ROAS sustaining reinvestment; pent-up e-comm demand expected to flow through with referral opening and international access.
- Cost outlook: Lean operating model; high flow-through (81% QoQ flow-through in Q2); incremental S&M to be tightly performance-managed.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Revenue growth +77% YoY and 81% EBITDA margin standout.
  - Guidance includes benefit from app divestiture; note the apparent EBITDA figure inconsistency.

6) Takeaways
- Axon self-serve is the next growth leg: Referral opening Oct 1, 2025, and global launch 1H26 should expand advertiser count well beyond gaming, with international web campaigns unlocked.
- Core engine remains powerful: Gaming ad business underpins 20–30% YoY growth potential; MAX supply still growing double digits; iterative model gains sustain outperformance.
- Financial quality is exceptional: 81% adj. EBITDA margin, 72% YoY FCF growth, and active buybacks; balance sheet strengthened by app divestiture proceeds.
- Near-term catalysts: Q4 holiday ramp from existing e-comm cohort, new referrals, and international expansion; medium-term AI/agent tooling and paid marketing to compound growth.
- Watch items: Execution on self-serve onboarding at scale, feature parity perceptions vs. social platforms, timing/size of Apple/Epic tailwind, and clarify Q3 EBITDA guidance typo vs. implied margin.
