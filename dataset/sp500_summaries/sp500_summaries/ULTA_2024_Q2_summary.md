1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA)
- Period: Fiscal 2Q24 (13 weeks ended August 3, 2024)
- Macro/industry context:
  - U.S. beauty category growth is normalizing after three years of outsized gains; 1H24 category growth ~3% (Cercana).
  - Prestige beauty still growing high single digits; mass beauty low single digits.
  - Consumers increasingly value-focused and cautious on discretionary spend.
  - Competitive intensity elevated: >1,000 new beauty distribution points (especially prestige) added across industry over last three years.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Net sales: $2.6B, +0.9% YoY
- Comparable sales: -1.2% (transactions -1.8%; average ticket +0.6%)
- E-commerce: low single-digit growth; acceleration through the quarter with promotions (particularly July)
- Operating margin: 12.9% vs. 15.5% LY (-260 bps)
- Gross margin: 38.3% vs. 39.3% LY (-100 bps), pressured by higher promos and adverse brand mix; partially offset by other revenue growth and lower shrink
- SG&A: $645M (25.3% of sales) vs. 23.7% LY (+160 bps); expense deleverage on softer top line; lower incentive comp offset some pressure
- Diluted EPS: $5.30 vs. $6.02 LY
- Inventory: $2.0B, +10.1% YoY (49 net new stores, new brands, Greer, SC MFC support)
- Loyalty: 43.9M active members, +5% YoY; continued growth in Platinum/Diamond tiers

Guidance (FY24)
- Net sales: $11.0–$11.2B (lowered; more cautious outlook)
- Comps: -2% to 0%
- Operating margin: 12.7%–13.0%
- Gross margin: expected deleverage of ~70–90 bps YoY (more promos, fixed-cost deleverage; offset by other revenue growth and lower transportation)

- Diluted EPS: $22.60–$23.50
- Cash/capex/capital return: Capex $400–$450M; share repurchases ~$1.0B; $1.6B remaining under $2B authorization at Q2 end

3) Management Commentary
- Key drivers of softer store transactions (four factors):
  1) Category normalization and value-seeking consumer behavior.
  2) Elevated competition: 80% of stores impacted by at least one nearby competitive opening; >50% impacted by multiple openings; share maintained in mass, lost in prestige (makeup, hair).
  3) ERP transition disruptions: dual-system period caused store inventory allocation challenges; all stores and DCs now on new platform; moving to optimization.
  4) Incremental promotions layered late in quarter: drove digital traffic/sales but lacked in-store incrementality; pressured ASP.
- Strategic priorities (five actions):
  - Strengthen assortment: new/exclusive brands (e.g., Sol de Janeiro expansions; Charlotte Tilbury; Ole Henriksen; Naturium; Naked Sundays; Orabella; Noise; Ilia and DIBS coming); collaborate with legacy brands; expand MAC, Kiehl’s; relaunch Ulta Beauty Collection (clean, cruelty-free, mass price point).
  - Expand social relevance: doubled influencer network; launched associate ambassador program (UB Beauties); new affiliate program (UB Creates); Joy Project chapter two; >250M social impressions; EMV up >10%.
  - Enhance digital experience: improved search/filtering; quick add-to-bag; personalized recommendations/upsell; app engagement +16%; app ≈ two-thirds of e-comm (up ~600 bps YoY); app users’ majority of spend is in-store.
  - Leverage loyalty: 43.9M members; “Member Love” points events; first member-tiered offer in July; deeper lifecycle engagement and targeted acquisition/retention planned.
  - Evolve promotions: focus on tentpole events (Big Summer Beauty Sale, 21 Days of Beauty) and targeted, data-driven offers; eliminate lower-ROI promotions.
- Shrink: improving; new fragrance fixtures rolled out chainwide (including rollerball protection); expect shrink roughly flat YoY.

Category performance
- Fragrance: double-digit growth; strength around Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, BTS; newness (Valentino, YSL, Burberry; exclusives Noise, Orabella, Kylie Jenner).
- Skincare: mid-single-digit comp growth; body care strong; derm brands strong (La Roche-Posay; new PanOxyl, Vanicream); prestige skincare pressured due to increased distribution and lapping prior social-driven spikes.
- Makeup: mid-single-digit comp decline; gains from Charlotte Tilbury, Polite Society, Wynn Beauty and Clinique exclusives offset by softer existing brands (newness underperformed or expanded distribution).
- Haircare: high single-digit comp decline, primarily timing shift of prestige hair event to Q1 and lapping strong LY newness; salon comps mid-single-digit growth.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Competition:
  - Multi-opening markets underperform; stores with no/limited new competition delivered positive comps; single early-opening markets tracking historical norms.
  - Prestige share pressure not worsening; mass share maintained.
- Promotions:
  - Tentpole events are effective; layered incremental promos late in Q2 confused value proposition in-store; plan to be more surgical and member-targeted in 2H; 2H inherently more promotional (holiday) but expected to be rational and below 2019 levels.
- SG&A:
  - Expect moderated growth in 2H; transformational investments largely complete; continued financial discipline while protecting sales-driving spend.
- ERP:
  - Most complex rollout (stores) completed; now optimizing; guidance incorporates remaining optimization costs; management confident for holiday.
- Store growth and Target partnership:
  - New stores performing well; small-format stores promising.
  - Ulta Beauty at Target: 541 locations; on track for 800; nearly 4M linked loyalty accounts; supportive of member acquisition/reactivation.
- Outlook/algorithm:
  - Long-term targets to be discussed at October Investor Day; management confident in model, but recovery to share-gain footing will take time.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand/trends: category still healthy but slowing; consumers more value-oriented; prestige growth strong but competition intense.
- Cost outlook: shrink improving; transportation costs lower; ERP optimization in-flight; SG&A growth to moderate.
- Capital allocation: strong FCF expected; repurchases continue; capex focused on stores, IT, fixtures.
- Surprises vs expectations: softer comps driven by store traffic; ERP-related disruptions; incremental promos under-delivered in-store; e-comm held up better.

6) Takeaways
- Competitive intensity, especially in prestige, and layered promotions hurt in-store productivity; stores facing multiple new entrants are most pressured.
- Q2 margins contracted on higher promos and deleverage; EPS declined; guidance cut reflects slower top line and a more promotional 2H.
- ERP rollout is complete; optimization underway; operational friction expected to ease heading into holiday.
- Offsetting positives: loyalty base up 5% YoY, app engagement strong, fragrance and body/skincare solid, salons growing, new/exclusive brands and tentpole events driving engagement.
- Management tone: cautious near-term, confident long-term; plans center on assortment newness, targeted promos, loyalty activation, and digital/app leverage.
