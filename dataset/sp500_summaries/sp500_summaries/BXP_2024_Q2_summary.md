*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP)
- Ticker: BXP
- Period: Q2 2024 (results and FY24 outlook)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Interest-rate outlook turning more favorable: June CPI at ~3% has the market pricing in accelerated Fed cuts; lower rates supportive for real estate values and financing.
  - Corporate earnings growth improving: S&P 500 EPS up 6.6% in Q1 and expected ~9% in Q2; management reiterates strong correlation between corporate earnings growth and BXP leasing demand.
  - “Premier workplace” segment continues to outperform broader office:
    - Direct vacancy: 13% vs. 18.5% for broader markets.
    - Net absorption (last 3 years): +6.9M sf vs. -22.8M sf for broader markets.
    - Asking rents: 51% premium vs. broader markets.
  - Return-to-office momentum building; Salesforce shifting to 3–5 days/week starting October, which management views as supportive for demand in SF and other tech-centric markets.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q2 2024 results:
  - FFO per share: $1.77
    - Beat midpoint of company guidance by $0.06 and Street by $0.05.
    - Portfolio NOI modestly ahead of plan (lower operating expenses).
    - Note: $0.05 benefit from a non-recurring, non-cash interest expense reversal related to Skyline (Oakland) earn-out reassessment; not part of forward run-rate.
- Occupancy/leasing:
  - CBD assets: 90.4% occupied; 92.2% leased (as of quarter-end).
  - Signed-not-yet-commenced: ~1.0M sf (c. 200 bps spread between “leased” and “occupied”).
  - Q2 leasing: 1.32M sf; WALT ~9 years; mark-to-market (commencements this quarter) +6%; transaction costs ~$11 psf/yr.
- FY 2024 guidance updates:
  - FFO per share: raised to $7.09–$7.15 (midpoint $7.12), +$0.08 vs. prior midpoint.
  - Same-property NOI growth: lowered by 25 bps to -1.5% to -3.0% (reflects timing of negotiated terminations; ex-terminations, same-store would be in line with prior outlook).
  - Termination income: increased to $14–$16M (up $8M).
  - Net interest expense: $578–$588M (reflects Q2 non-cash interest benefit).
  - Interest-rate planning assumption: one 25 bps cut in December; three cuts starting in September would reduce interest expense by ~$2M (~$0.01/sh), within guidance range.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and portfolio positioning:
  - Focus on premier workplaces in CBDs (c. 90% of NOI), gaining share as weaker owners disinvest.
  - Continue to invest in amenity-rich, well-capitalized assets to attract/retain top-tier tenants (numerous amenity projects across markets underway or completed).
- Capital allocation:
  - Limited acquisitions in premier segment given muted transaction market and bid-ask gaps; remain active with owners/lenders.
  - Dispositions: negotiating sale of four land positions (~$150M potential proceeds; ~half targeted in 2024).
  - Development:
    - Delivered: Dick’s House of Sport (118k sf) at Boston Prudential Center; Skymark (508-unit luxury resi) at Reston Town Center opened July 12—21% pre-leased, rents modestly above plan.
    - Pipeline: 10 projects (office/lab/retail/resi), 3.1M sf; BXP investment $2.3B, $1.2B remaining to fund.
    - Residential strategy: prioritize projects on controlled land; target mid-6%+ untrended yields; utilize JV equity (Skymark structure ~20% BXP/80% JV partner as a template); suburban stick-frame more likely to pencil near term vs. CBD towers.
- Market updates by region/segment:
  - New York (Park Ave): sub-8% availability; face rents up double-digits YTD; concessions stable to tightening; strong demand from financials, asset managers, professional services, law firms; tech demand still light.
  - Boston: Back Bay outperforms Financial District; active leasing in urban edge/Waltham office; lab demand in Greater Boston remains lackluster with limited large new deals.
  - Washington, DC/NoVA: Reston driving activity (cyber/defense); DC bifurcated with many over-levered assets unable to fund TI/LC; BXP expects well-capitalized, amenity-rich buildings (e.g., 2200 Penn, 901 New York Ave) to fare better.
  - San Francisco: improving vs. 2023 but tech downsizings/sublets still a headwind; demand centered on professional services/finance at Embarcadero; AI-related demand growing but not offsetting broader tech softness; R&D product in Mountain View seeing better activity; South SF lab mirrors Boston (slow but recent green shoots).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Occupancy trajectory:
  - Near-term: Q3 down ~40 bps (including July expiration at Times Square Tower), recovery in Q4 as commencements ramp; YE occupied 87.0–87.5% (leased remains >89%).
  - 2025: management expects occupancy to move into the 88% range; timing depends on buildout cycles (12–16 months).
  - Adds to in-service: two Waltham life science buildings (combined 32% leased) entering in 2H24 will reduce reported occupancy by ~50 bps.
- Leasing mix and pricing:
  - Roughly ~40% of recent leasing is true vacancy absorption; remainder renewals (many are forward starts for 2025–2026).
  - Starting rents on signed Q2 leases: +8% Boston; flat NY; -6% DC; -7% West Coast; concessions stable overall, tightening in select submarkets (Park Ave).
- Capital and leverage:
  - Leverage elevated near term from development funding; expected to moderate as 100%-leased Cambridge projects deliver (300 Binney in Q1’25; 290 Binney in 2026). Pro forma leverage could decline by ~1 turn back into the 6.5x–7.5x target range over time.
  - Considering refinancing $850M 3.35% bond due Jan 2025 possibly in 2024; proceeds would earn ~5% in deposits until redemption; not in guidance.
- Capex:
  - Maintenance capex: $80–$100M (FY24).
  - Repositioning capex elevated at 200 Clarendon (major amenity center) and other targeted upgrades; lease transaction costs run-rate ~$200–$240M annually (AFFO relevant).
- Terminations:
  - Three negotiated (Boston), enabling larger/new tenants to backfill; net temporary reduction ~100k sf in 2024 with backfill in 6–12 months; boosts termination income but lowers same-store NOI modestly in 2024.
- Elections:
  - Minimal expected impact at federal level; state/local policies (taxes, entitlements, transit, public safety) matter more for operations and demand.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Constructively cautious with improving operating environment; confidence in premier segment outperformance and in leasing pipeline translating to higher occupancy over time.
- Demand trends:
  - Strongest in financial/professional sectors in NY/Boston; tech/life sciences still subdued but signs of stabilization/digestion and capital formation returning; RTO policies are incrementally supportive.
- Costs and capital:
  - Concessions largely flat; selective tightening in tight submarkets; investment in amenities viewed as table stakes.
  - Interest-rate backdrop potentially improving; guidance conservatively assumes only one 25 bps cut in December.
- Transaction market:
  - Premier assets: owners “testing the market”; bid exists but bid-ask remains wide; limited distressed opportunities in premier segment.

6) Takeaways
- BXP beat Q2 FFO and raised FY24 FFO guidance; operational performance modestly ahead with a one-time non-cash interest benefit.
- Leasing momentum improved materially (1.3M sf in Q2; pipeline suggests meeting or exceeding 4M sf FY guidance), with strongest demand in premier CBD assets in NY/Boston.
- Occupancy will dip near term due to known expirations, dev assets entering service, and negotiated terminations, but management expects a gradual uptrend into 2025 as signed leases commence.
- Same-property NOI revised slightly lower for 2024 (-1.5% to -3.0%) due to timing of terminations; rent levels in top submarkets rising with stable-to-improving concessions.
- Balance sheet positioned to bridge near-term development funding; leverage expected to ease as 100%-leased Cambridge projects deliver; potential 2024 bond refi optionality.

7) Other Notable Information
- Sustainability: 2023 Sustainability & Impact Report released; recognized by Time Magazine as one of the world’s most sustainable companies (No.1 in the U.S. among property owners). Management believes ESG leadership lowers cost of capital and supports client demand.
- Development/stabilization timing:
  - Capitalized interest stops 12 months after base-building completion; in-service timing can temporarily depress reported occupancy prior to lease-up.
- Asset-level amenity investments:
  - Ongoing/complete upgrades at Embarcadero Center (new indoor/outdoor amenity and conference center), Sumner Square, 901 New York Ave, 200 Clarendon, Prudential Center (View Boston), 140 Kendrick; designed to drive retention, higher rents, and velocity.
- Dispositions: negotiating four land sales (~$150M total; ~50% in 2024).
- Market-color specifics:
  - Park Ave (NY): net effective rents now above 6–12 months ago; availability sub-8% spurring competition.
  - San Francisco: professional services/finance drive most activity; AI demand emerging but not yet offsetting broader tech softness; sublease competition persists.
  - Life sciences (Boston/SSF): limited large new deals YTD, but recent green shoots (~100k sf in last 30 days in SSF).
