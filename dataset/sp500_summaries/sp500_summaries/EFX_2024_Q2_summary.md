Quarter & Company Context

Management Commentary
- Cloud transformation:
  - USIS consumer and telco/utilities migrations finishing “in the next few weeks.” Canada completes next month; Spain by YE24; UK 1H25; LatAm (Argentina, Chile done; more in 2H).
  - Decommissioning legacy systems begins 3Q (USIS) driving cost savings, lower capex, margin lift; biggest benefit 4Q and annualized in 2025.
- Strategy/innovation:
  - Pivot from build to leverage: faster NPI, integrated USIS (credit) + EWS (income/employment) solutions (mortgage, auto, cards, personal loans).
  - EFX.ai + Google Vertex AI embedded across Ignite (analytics) and InterConnect (decisioning); improved model performance and time-to-market.
- EWS growth vectors:
  - Government: largest vertical; 3-yr CAGR >50%; continued state penetration into ~$5B TAM; CMS contract has escalators; ACA enrollment seasonal uplift in 4Q.
  - Talent: accelerating from new products (incarceration, education, hourly screening) and penetration; outperformed BLS white-collar hiring by ~19 pts.
  - Records: +8M active in Q2 to 180M active (132M unique individuals); 4 new partners (3M+ records) to onboard in 4Q; pipeline in pensions, 1099, HR software/payroll.
- International:
  - Brazil (Boa Vista) integration on track: InterConnect (SMB) launched; Ignite apps live; Count/Mitigator available; accelerating negative data acquisition.

Q&A Highlights
- Cost savings cadence: Most cloud-related savings materialize in 4Q (decommissioning timing), fully annualized in 2025. FY margin lower vs April purely timing; 2025 savings intact.
- Guidance posture: Balanced; assumes continued weak mortgage and auto demand; excludes any Fed cuts or mortgage rebound. Upside levers include records onboarding and seasonal EWS tailwinds.
- USIS outlook: Q3 non‑mortgage growth modest (>2%); cloud completion reduces distraction and enables share gains/NPI, with more visible acceleration in 2025. Auto headwind persists from rates; CDK outage is behind them. ID & Fraud softer; Count (fraud) improving with Count360; chargeback management (Mitigator) softer near-term.
- EWS Mortgage: Outperformance vs inquiries to improve in 2H driven by record additions; twin inquiries expected to converge toward credit inquiries as shopping normalizes.
- Records strategy: Mix of large (pension administrators, major gig platforms/HR software) and granular contributors; dedicated teams for W‑2, pensions, 1099.
- International: LatAm strength broad-based (Argentina, Paraguay, Central America); Brazil impacted by flooding but on plan; Europe strong (CRA and debt management).

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking:
  - Non-mortgage growth targeted ~10% CC in 2H; EWS Verifier non-mortgage high-teens to ~20% growth sustained by records and vertical penetration.
  - Mortgage optionality: >$1.1B revenue recovery, ~$700M EBITDA, ~$4 EPS when market normalizes back toward historical average (not in 2024 guidance).
  - Capital allocation: leverage toward ~2.5x by YE24; sets stage to resume dividend growth and share repurchases, plus bolt-on M&A, in 2025.
  - Capex trending down; long-term target 6–7% of revenue exiting 2025.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Q2 beat on revenue/EPS; stronger EWS Verifier and International; USIS non-mortgage softer than expected due to cloud focus and auto/ID&F pressure.
  - FY EBITDA margin trimmed on timing of cloud decommissioning; no change to revenue/EPS midpoints.

Takeaways
- Nearing the end of a multi-year cloud transformation; decommissioning begins in 3Q, with the bulk of cost/margin benefits in 4Q and fully annualized in 2025.
- EWS remains the growth engine ex-mortgage: Government and Talent strong; record additions accelerating, providing high-visibility revenue lift in 2H.
- USIS mortgage growth robust from pricing and pre-qual; USIS non-mortgage should improve post-migration, but the more material acceleration is a 2025 story.
- Macro headwinds persist in mortgage and rate-sensitive auto demand; no Fed cuts assumed—provides potential upside if cuts occur.
- International momentum broad-based, with Brazil integration milestones achieved and further product rollouts ahead.

Other Notable Information
- Leadership: EWS leadership transition—longtime leader Rudy Ploder recognized; Chad Borton (joined May) now leading EWS. IR changes: Sam McKinstry moves to USIS; Molly Clegg joins IR.
- Identity & Fraud: Fraud (Count) performing better than chargeback management (Mitigator); Count360 launched, integration underway to improve trajectory.
- Operational notes: CDK auto software outage impacted late Q2 auto volumes; behind the company now. Brazil floods impacted activity in the south.
- Ratings/leverage: Current leverage ~3.0x; management believes target leverage aligns with existing credit ratings.
