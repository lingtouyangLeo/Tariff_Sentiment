  - Net card fees: +19% FX-adjusted; 26th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
  - VCE-to-revenue ratio: 43%; rewards expense +15% (partly due to model changes); marketing $6B in 2024 (+16% YoY); operating expense Q4 $4.2B (-1% YoY).
  - Credit: Delinquencies/write-offs stable QoQ and below pre-COVID; provision down YoY on lower reserve builds.
- Balance sheet and capital:
  - CET1: 10.5% (target range 10–11%).
  - Dividend: expected +17% in 2025 to $0.82/sh quarterly (target payout 20–25%).
- Guidance (2025):
  - Revenue growth: 8–10% (FX-adjusted framing; FX can be a headwind).
  - EPS: $15.00–$15.50, implying +12–16% vs. 2024 adjusted for the gain on sale cited by management.
  - Building blocks/guidance detail:
    - Billings assumed similar to FY2024 on full-year basis; if Q4-level momentum persists, revenue likely toward top of range (all else equal).
    - Loans/receivables to grow slightly faster than spend; NII growth expected to outpace loans/receivables on higher revolving balances.
    - VCE to grow slightly faster than revenue (portfolio more premium; engagement investment).
    - Rewards growth elevated in Q1 (model changes), then normalizes.
    - Marketing: modest increase vs. 2024.
    - Operating expenses: low single-digit growth vs. 2024 (adjusted for the gain on sale).

Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Continued product refresh cadence (35–50 products/year) across consumer and commercial; maintain pace through 2025.
  - Membership model enhancements, experiential benefits (lounges, events), and top-tier partnerships (e.g., Formula 1) to deepen engagement.
  - Dining platform expansion via acquisitions of Tock and Rooam (spelled “Roam” in remarks).
  - International: underpenetrated with ~6% spend share in top markets; large runway in consumer and SME, supported by rising merchant coverage.
  - SME: expand beyond the card (lending, checking, cash flow management) and leverage Kabbage capabilities.
  - Deposits: high-yield savings balances +17% in 2024; skewing younger (Millennial/Gen Z >50% of accounts).
- Risks/challenges:
  - FX strength a headwind; interest-rate, tax, and regulatory uncertainty noted.
  - Credit metrics expected to trend modestly higher over time due to seasoning from elevated new acquisitions, though remain best-in-class.
  - Q1 comp headwind from fewer days vs. 2024 due to leap year shift.

Q&A Highlights
- Revenue guide mechanics:
  - Position within 8–10% range is largely a billings story; Q4-style spend would bias to high end. Card fees expected mid-to-high teens growth (moderating later in 2025). NII growth continues but at a lower pace than early 2024.
  - EPS flexibility: if upside emerges, management may reinvest (marketing, tech, value props) or allow more to flow through; 2025 EPS range already contemplates reinvestment options.
- Spend drivers:
  - Q4 uplift broad-based; T&E strong, with airline particularly robust (front-of-cabin spend up strongly). Early January spend trends similar to Q4, but management is cautious about sustainability.
  - Contribution to billings: roughly ~7% from newly acquired customers; organic spend variability is the swing factor; attrition remains very low/stable.
- SME:
  - Organic spend improving but still below pre-pandemic trajectory; a return to ~3% organic lift would materially help SME contribution. Acquisition and attrition trends stable.
  - Competitive tech (Ramp/Brex) monitored; Amex focused on integrated solutions via Kabbage and ongoing product/tech enhancements.
- Competition:
  - Co-brand: Delta momentum strong; Amex remuneration to Delta expected to rise alongside spending.
  - Capital One–Discover: seen as a smart, scale-enhancing deal for COF; Amex expects heightened competition but also integration distractions for peers; Amex will continue differentiating via premium, experience, and product refresh cycle.
  - Consumer fintech cashback offers: limited impact on Amex’s premium customer base, which values experience, access, service, and rewards balance more than pure cashback.
- Credit:
  - Metrics still materially better than pre-COVID. Expect modest upward drift due to seasoning; management comfortable with risk profile given premium skew.
- Marketing allocation:
  - Majority of recent increase directed to acquisition; balanced between existing customer deepening (upgrades/companion) and new prospect acquisition; brand/sponsorship relatively stable.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends:
  - Consumer and SME confidence improved into year-end; travel (especially premium cabins) robust; international still the fastest-growing segment.
  - Early 2025 spend pacing similar to Q4, but management refrains from extrapolating one quarter.
- Cost outlook:
  - Continued high levels of investment in value propositions, experiences, marketing, and technology; VCE growth slightly above revenue; operating expenses tightly managed (low single-digit growth).
- Capital allocation:
  - Dividend increase to $0.82/sh; continued buybacks within CET1 target range (10–11%).
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Q4 spend strength exceeded internal expectations, especially in airline/front-of-cabin; credit remained better than anticipated; guidance embeds caution on sustainability and macro uncertainty.

Takeaways
- Amex delivered record FY2024 results with strong Q4 spend acceleration; premium, fee-led model continues to perform with best-in-class credit and 35% ROE.
- 2025 guide (8–10% revenue, $15.00–$15.50 EPS) hinges on billings; sustained Q4 spend would push revenue toward the high end; EPS has reinvestment optionality.
- International and premium Millennial/Gen Z cohorts remain key growth engines; SME organic spend is improving but still a watch item.
- Investment cadence stays elevated (product refreshes, experiences, tech), while operating discipline supports leverage; card fee growth to remain mid-to-high teens but moderate later in the year.
- Competition intensifying (COF–DFS, fintechs), but Amex’s differentiated premium value proposition and experience-led ecosystem continue to resonate.
