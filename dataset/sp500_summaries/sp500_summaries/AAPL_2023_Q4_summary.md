Guidance (December quarter, 13 weeks vs. 14 weeks last year; extra week added ~7 pts to last year)

- iPhone: YoY growth on absolute basis; also up when normalizing for last year’s supply disruptions and extra week
- Mac: YoY performance to “significantly accelerate” from September quarter

- iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max supply: constrained now; expect supply-demand balance by quarter-end (reflected in outlook)

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and products:
  - iPhone 15 family launched; Pro line features A17 Pro, titanium design, 5x telephoto (Pro Max)
  - M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max unveiled; new MacBook Pro and iMac launched
  - Services expansions: more Apple TV+ content, Arcade titles, new iCloud storage tiers; MLS Season Pass exceeded expectations
  - Vision Pro on track for early 2024, sold via Apple Stores with in-store demos; strong developer enthusiasm
  - Retail expansion: first stores in India; openings in Korea, China, UK; online in Vietnam & Chile
  - Enterprise traction: Starbucks (iPad fleet; 10k+ MacBook Air refresh), GoTo (Indonesia) with majority choosing Mac
  - Environmental: first carbon-neutral products (Apple Watch models); target carbon-neutral across lineup by 2030; >300 suppliers to 100% clean energy for Apple production
- Technology posture:
  - AI/ML viewed as foundational across products (e.g., Personal Voice, Live Voicemail, crash/fall detection, ECG)
  - Investing “quite a bit” in generative AI; will advance products responsibly
  - Continued commitment to in-house silicon; strategic and product differentiation benefits
- Supply chain:
  - Global, diversified; continued optimization; investing in advanced manufacturing in the U.S. (Corning, Face ID modules, semis) and globally

- Risks/challenges:
  - FX headwinds ongoing
  - Tough comps for Mac/iPad due to prior-year supply disruption timing
  - iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max near-term constraints
  - China competitive intensity at high-end; regulatory scrutiny on services partnerships (search licensing)
  - Potential component cost inflation turning less favorable over time

4) Q&A Highlights
- iPhone mix/storage: Pro Max starts at 256GB; mix differs vs. last year; no major shifts beyond that
- China: Greater China revenue -2% reported but +CC; iPhone September-quarter record in mainland; Mac/iPad weighed due to compares; management optimistic long term; likely share gains if market contracted as predicted
- Gross margin drivers: Product mix and cost improvements; services mix accretive but less impactful in December due to product-heavy season; FX a continuing drag
- Supply constraints: 15 Pro/Pro Max constrained now; expect balance by quarter’s end; guidance reflects this
- Capex intensity: Main areas are tooling/equipment, data centers, facilities; hybrid investment model with partners; will invest as needed to innovate
- U.S. carriers/promotions: Too early to call cycle given Pro constraints; upgrade/switch rates TBD
- Services acceleration: Broad-based strength; records in every category and across regions; driven by growing installed base, engagement, more transacting/paid accounts, and added features/content
- Vision Pro launch: Distinct from Watch/AirPods; store-only with demos; strong developer momentum and “blow-away” apps emerging
- Generative AI: Significant, responsible investments underway; product impacts will surface over time
- Silicon strategy: Insourcing core; unlikely to revert to merchant; key to product differentiation and margins
- Supply chain diversification/U.S. investments: Ongoing global optimization; advanced manufacturing in U.S.; will remain global
- R&D spend rise: Driven by Vision Pro, AI/ML, silicon, and other projects; also supports GM expansion
- Customer lifetime value: Focus on installed base growth, engagement, conversion to paid, and expanding services (e.g., payments) to monetize over time

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on iPhone cycle (despite early supply constraints), services momentum, emerging markets, and Mac recovery with M3
- Demand trends:
  - iPhone: Growth expected YoY in December even after normalizations
  - Mac: Meaningful acceleration expected
  - Services: Sustained double-digit weekly growth
  - China: Positive constant-currency growth; iPhone share likely up; strong customer interactions
  - India: All-time record; major focus; long runway with low share and rising middle class
- Cost outlook: Improved product costs and mix; FX remains headwind; acknowledgment that component cost tailwinds could normalize
- Capital allocation: Continued strong buybacks/dividends; net cash neutral target unchanged
- Surprises vs. expectations: Strong services outperformance and breadth; robust GM guidance; iPhone growth outlook despite 1-less-week headwind; Pro/Pro Max supply expected to catch up by quarter end

6) Takeaways
- Services is the growth and margin engine: +16% YoY to an all-time high with records across every category; over 1B paid subs; GM ~71%.
- iPhone resilient with emerging market strength: September-quarter record; Pro/Pro Max supply constraints near-term but expected to balance by quarter end; Dec quarter iPhone up YoY even after normalizations.
- Mac set for rebound: Tough Q4 comp (-34% YoY), but new M3 lineup and clean compares position Mac for significant YoY acceleration in December.
- FX headwinds persist, but margins strong: Company GM at 45.2% with guidance to 45–46%; mix, cost down the curves, and services accretion offset FX drag.
- Strategic investments continue: Vision Pro early 2024 via store-led demos; heavy AI/ML and silicon investment; expanding retail presence (notably India); advancing environmental goals and enterprise traction.

Balanced view:
- Positives: Services momentum and profitability; sizable installed base and engagement; iPhone growth outlook; Mac recovery; strong capital returns; emerging markets (India) traction.
- Negatives: FX headwinds; soft Mac/iPad comps; near-term iPhone Pro/Pro Max constraints; competitive intensity in China.
- Uncertainties: Component cost environment could turn inflationary; regulatory scrutiny of services partnerships; macro remaining “uneven.”
