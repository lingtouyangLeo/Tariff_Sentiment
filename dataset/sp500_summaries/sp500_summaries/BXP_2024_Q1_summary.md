# Analysis: BXP_2024_Q1.txt

*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP)
- Ticker: BXP
- Period: Q1 2024
- Macro/industry context:
  - Two key external drivers: long-term interest rates and corporate earnings growth.
  - S&P 500 earnings projected to grow 11–13% over the next two years (vs. 0% in 2023), which BXP expects will support office leasing demand.
  - Office-using job creation remains muted (~7% of new jobs vs. 25% long-term average).
  - Clear bifurcation: “Premier workplaces” (top 6% of buildings; 13% of space) materially outperform broader markets (vacancy 11.2% vs. 17.9%; 7M sf positive net absorption vs. -30M sf for broader market; asking rents ~50% higher).
  - Tech sector in “digestion” mode after overcommitting during the pandemic; AI driving net new demand in San Francisco.
  - Bank lending for new office construction is scarce and expensive; new office supply expected to be very limited for several years.

2) Headline Financial Results
- FFO: $1.73/share (Q1), in line with guidance and equal to Q1 2023.
- Revenue/NOI: Total revenue +$10M QoQ (+1.3%); BXP share of portfolio NOI +$6M QoQ (+1.2%).
- Occupancy: 88.2% vs. 88.4% in Q4 (expected slight dip in Q2, then improvement in H2).
- Leasing: ~900k sf (35% above Q1 2023), WALT 11.6 years (vs. 8.2 years in 2023 signings).
- Rent economics:
  - Mark-to-market on commenced leases: +7%.
  - Starting cash rents on executed leases vs. prior in-place: ~+2% overall.
  - Second-gen starting cash rent change by market: Boston +23% (adjusted +6% excluding a defaulted tenant), Manhattan -6.5%, DC -3%, West Coast +8% (SF CBD +12%).
  - Transaction costs: $8.60 psf per year, lower than recent quarters.
- Guidance:
  - 2024 FFO: $6.98–$7.10/share (midpoint down $0.06 from prior).
  - Same-property NOI growth: -1% to +3% (unchanged).
  - Drivers of guidance reduction: +$0.05 non-cash fair value interest expense from acquired below-market debt adjustments; +$0.02 higher short-term rates; -$0.01 G&A.
  - Rate cuts now assumed late 2024; minimal impact if none occur in 2024.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/execution:
  - Leasing: building momentum with stronger pipeline; focus on gaining market share in premier assets.
  - Investments: pivoted to offense—acquired JV interests in three in-service assets; pursuing opportunities from lender-driven recaps and institutions diversifying away from office. Expect more deal flow as maturities rise and portfolios re-mark.
  - Development: commenced 121 Broadway (439-unit residential, tallest in Cambridge) as part of Cambridge entitlement package tied to 290 Binney (fully leased to AstraZeneca) and future commercial entitlements. Opened Dick’s House of Sports (118k sf) at Prudential Center. Advancing several residential projects, targeting JV equity in H2 2024.
  - Office development: client interest exists, but premium-to-market anchor rents required to underwrite new starts given higher construction and capital costs; pipeline slowed. Very limited new office supply ahead supports existing portfolio rents over time.
  - Dispositions: evaluating a handful of < $30M asset sales to raise capital.
- Capital & balance sheet:
  - Paid off $700M unsecured notes with cash.
  - Launched $500M unsecured commercial paper program (SOFR+25bp; ~5.75% all-in), used to pay down term loan from $1.2B to $700M, saving ~75bp (~$0.01/share in 2024).
  - Increased revolver by $185M to $2.0B.
  - Closed JV with Norges at 290 Binney, mitigating $534M of development funding.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Elevated rates (interest expense, development yields, weak construction finance).
  - Tech sector space digestion, softer West Coast (except AI in SF).
  - Inflation still sticky in base building costs; TI costs easing.
  - Potential municipal tax pressure (e.g., Boston) viewed as negative for competitiveness.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Investment focus/funding: Will evaluate opportunities case-by-case; goal to be accretive and maintain leverage discipline. 121 Broadway economics below standalone hurdles but justified when viewed with broader Cambridge entitlement package (incl. 290 Binney and future commercial site).
- Leasing pipeline: >875k sf under legal negotiation (mostly in-service portfolio); 817k sf signed not yet commenced on vacancy (624k sf set to commence in 2024); additional 534k sf signed by new clients for currently occupied space (future rollover protection).
- Demand trends:
  - Strong: asset managers (PE, hedge, venture), legal, financial services; East Coast stronger than West.
  - AI: meaningful, SF-led; offsets weakness from traditional tech.
  - Suburban/urban edge: Waltham activity improving; Princeton activity notably higher (pharma/corporate functions).
  - DC/NoVA: bifurcation—over-levered buildings sidelined; BXP benefiting from flight to quality/certainty.
- Specific assets:
  - 680 Folsom (200k sf) just vacated; quality space, active proposals.
  - 7 Times Square (230k sf, 55% owned) demand choppy; converting subtenants to direct; Times Square submarket weaker.
  - 535 Mission: WeWork likely to remain; Zillow vacated; spec suites leasing on upper floors.
  - 360 Park Ave South: tours picking up post-completion; diversified tenant interest beyond tech/media.
- Utilization: BXP’s turnstile data shows Tue–Thu NYC back to pre-COVID levels; Boston ~75%; SF 45–50%. Castle data viewed as imperfect; peak days matter for space planning.
- Life science: Demand slow; smaller deal sizes (10–20k sf) in South San Francisco; Waltham sentiment improving with better funding/trial progress; no Cambridge vacancy.
- Development finance: Construction loans scarce; if available, ~SOFR+300–400 (8–9% all-in); development yields have risen ~200 bp for office/lab. Residential development needs mid-6%+ untrended yield and often JV capital.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward look:
  - Leasing: Expect dip in occupancy in Q2 (680 Folsom, 7 Times Sq expirations), then improvement in H2 as signed/negotiated leases commence; NOI expected up in H2.
  - Transactions: Anticipate increased activity as maturities force resolution and portfolios mark down; growing co-investor interest alongside BXP.
  - Costs: TI costs easing; core construction costs and interest rates still high; little new office supply, supportive for rents in premier assets.
  - Capital allocation: Opportunistic small asset sales; continued use of commercial paper; largely fixed-rate philosophy preserved.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Guidance cut driven mainly by non-cash FV interest expense and higher-for-longer short-term rates.
  - Stronger leasing YoY with longer WALT; positive cash rent spreads overall, with mixed market-level outcomes.

6) Takeaways
- BXP’s premier assets continue to outperform, driving resilient FFO and stable occupancy despite sector headwinds; Q1 leasing up 35% YoY with notably longer lease terms.
- 2024 FFO guidance trimmed mainly due to non-cash interest adjustments and rate assumptions, not operating deterioration; NOI expected to improve in H2 as leases commence.
- Capital discipline intact: reduced term loan via new commercial paper program, extended liquidity, and JV funding at 290 Binney; selective on development and acquisitions.
- Demand is concentrated in asset managers and AI-led SF tech; East Coast stronger than West; suburban “urban edge” pockets (Waltham, Princeton, Reston) showing momentum.
- New office construction is largely on hold industry-wide; limited future supply should support rent recovery in premier workplaces over time, but timing depends on corporate earnings growth and rate trajectory.

7) Other Notable Information
- Sustainability: Published 2023 Sustainability & Impact Report; targeting net zero carbon operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 2025; sustainability webcast on May 15.
- Development portfolio: 11 active projects across office/lab/retail/residential totaling ~3.2M sf; ~$2.4B BXP investment with ~$1.3B remaining; expected attractive aggregate yields.
- Residential strategy: 121 Broadway tied to broader Cambridge entitlement economics; advancing multiple residential entitlements/conversions on land holdings (e.g., Lexington 17 Hartwell ~350 units; Shady Grove MD; Herndon VA rezoned to multifamily/townhomes; San Jose North First pursuing residential entitlements; long-term mixed-use optionality at Santa Monica Business Park).
- Policy risk: BXP voiced opposition to potential Boston commercial tax increases, citing competitiveness and current sector challenges.
