3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and investments:
  - Accelerating investments in marketing, product value, technology, control management, and talent.
  - Plan to refresh ~40 products globally in 2024; U.S. Consumer Gold Card refresh coming in weeks.
  - Bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen dining ecosystem (planned acquisitions of “Tock” and “Rome”) and continued growth of Resi to deepen consumer and merchant value.
  - Digital banking build-out is an ongoing, multi-year engagement journey for both consumers and SMEs.
- Scale and efficiency:
  - Since YE’21: revenue +~50%, billings +~40%, cards-in-force +~23M (~+20%), merchant locations +~30M (~+50%).
  - Operating leverage from scale and cost discipline enables elevated investment while growing earnings.
- Customer base:
  - Premium customer profile drives spend and credit outcomes; 70% of new accounts in Q2 were fee-based products.
  - 3.3M new cards acquired in Q2; retention remains strong.
  - Millennials/Gen Z now 33% of billings; spend +13% YoY; ~25% more transactions than older cohorts and nearly 2x in dining.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Softer U.S. organic spend growth; modest SME growth; selective T&E category softness (airline/lodging).
  - NII growth and loan growth expected to moderate in 2H; reserve seasonality may lift CECL modestly.
  - Large/global corporate spend flat; one client-specific usage drop flagged.

4) Q&A Highlights
- U.S. consumer and SME trends: U.S. consumer +6% (leap-year base effect noted); Millennials/Gen Z remain key driver. SME spending improved slightly sequentially but modest overall. International continues to outpace at +13%.
- Revenue guidance stance: Comfort with 9–11% FY range; mid-to-lower end vs. mid depending on organic spend trajectory.
- Marketing ramp rationale: Opportunity-driven and supported by stronger core earnings; not a reaction to competitor pullback (environment remains very competitive). Allocation remains dynamic across U.S. consumer, international, and SME; focus on acquisition for medium/long-term growth.
- Gold Card refresh: Imminent; expected to enhance acquisition, upgrades, and marketing efficacy; specifics withheld pre-launch.
- Business development expense: Some in-quarter efficiencies; no co-brand issues.
- Funding the spend vs. one-time gain: Entire $0.66 gain flows to EPS; elevated marketing funded by core earnings, with a slight increase vs original plan given visibility into 2H performance.
- Credit outlook: Shifted to stable write-offs ~2.1% for rest of 2024; reserve ratio ~2.8–2.9% as delinquencies exhibit normal seasonality.
- 2025 EPS growth baseline: Mid-teens still the aspiration off a base that excludes the 2024 one-off gain; higher 2024 core-funded marketing resets a higher run-rate for growth investments next year.
- Card fees: Expect some acceleration in 2H from product refreshes and strong renewals (no specific growth target provided).
- 2H EPS cadence: Deceleration vs 1H driven by higher marketing, expected reserve build, and seasonal opex; underlying run-rate remains strong.
- NII trajectory: Growth to moderate as loan growth slows and funding mix shifts toward high-yield savings; still an effective funding channel for AXP.
- Discount revenue/spend: Planning for continued stable spend environment; upside would be additive.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand: Stable; millennials/Gen Z and international remain strong pillars; SME improving slightly; large corp stable overall.
- Cost outlook: Marketing sustained at elevated levels, funded organically; variable engagement ~42% of revenue; opex ex-gain roughly flat YoY for FY, with typical 4Q seasonal lift.
- Capital allocation: Robust buybacks and steady dividends implied; no near-term changes to capital approach; stress test results reinforce resilience (lowest SCB at 2.5%).
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: EPS guidance raised; unusual decision to let entire one-off gain drop to bottom line; marketing spend lifted to a record ~$6B while maintaining EPS trajectory.
  - Mixed: T&E category softness in airlines/lodging; large/global corporate flat due to client-specific factor.

6) Takeaways
- AXP is delivering record revenue and strong EPS growth, raising full-year EPS guidance while funding a step-up in marketing entirely from core earnings.
- Spend growth is stable but slower in the U.S.; international remains the growth engine; millennials/Gen Z continue to outperform.
- Credit remains a standout positive with stable write-offs around 2.1% expected for 2H and reserve ratio ~2.8–2.9%.
- Marketing reset to ~$6B in 2024 should bolster 2025 growth, aided by ~40 product refreshes (U.S. Gold refresh imminent).
- NII and loan growth are set to moderate in 2H; expect seasonal opex and modest reserve builds to weigh on near-term EPS cadence.

7) Other Notable Information
