Autodesk (ADSK) – Fiscal Q2 2024 Earnings Call Summary

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company/Quarter: Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK); Fiscal Q2 2024.
- Macro/Industry context:
  - Continued macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds; FX a headwind to reported growth and margins.
  - New subscriber acquisition remains dragged by macro, but leading indicators steady: growing product usage, record bid activity on BuildingConnected, cautious optimism from channel partners.
  - Customers leaning into automation and digital transformation to address labor and supply chain constraints.
  - Writers/actors strike presents risk to Media & Entertainment (M&E), though company exposure is comparatively small.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Revenue growth: +9% reported, +12% constant currency (CC).
  - Product (CC): AutoCAD/LT +9%; AEC +14%; Manufacturing +9% (double digits ex upfront revenue variance); M&E +10%.
  - Region (CC): Americas +15%; EMEA +11%; APAC +6%.
- Mix/Other:
  - Direct revenue +18% YoY; 37% of total revenue (up 3 pts), driven by EBAs and eStore.
  - Net revenue retention: 100–110% at constant FX.
  - Billing transition: Full-quarter impact from shifting multi-year contracts to annual billings; billings declined 8%.
  - Deferred revenue: $4.2B (+14%).
  - RPO: Total $5.2B (+11%); Current $3.5B (+12%).
- Profitability/Cash:
  - Non-GAAP gross margin ~92% (flat).
  - GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins broadly level YoY (CC improvement offset by FX).
  - Free cash flow (FCF): $128M (above expectations; timing of EBA billings and favorable linearity).
- Capital allocation: Repurchased ~400k shares for $87M (~$200 avg price).
- Guidance (FY24):
  - Revenue: $5.41–$5.46B (raised lower end; underlying momentum consistent).
  - Non-GAAP operating margin: Similar to FY23; CC improvement offset by FX headwind.
  - FCF: $1.17–$1.25B (FY24 remains FCF trough due to billing shift).
  - Non-GAAP EPS: $7.30–$7.49 (raised; higher interest income and reduced downside risk).
  - Cash tax rate: ~31% of GAAP PBT (vs. 25% in FY23); federal tax payment extension shifts cash taxes into Q3, skewing 2H FCF to Q4.
  - Rule of 40: Managing toward 45%+ over time; path not linear during billing transition/macro.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives/market updates:
  - AEC momentum: Customers standardizing on Autodesk’s cloud-connected design-to-make workflows; growing engagement from asset owners. U.S. Advanced Digital Construction Management System (ADCMS) program should catalyze DOT digital modernization.
  - Construction: Sales force integration largely stabilized; expected to enhance scale in design-centric accounts. Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) MAUs up >100% in the quarter; notable wins (e.g., Shook Construction).
  - Manufacturing: Cross-industry workflow convergence (AEC + manufacturing) driving EBA expansions; strengthening BIM adoption (Revit, Navisworks, ACC).
  - Fusion: 236k subscribers; expanding into electronics/EDA and PCB design; driving connected cloud workflows.
  - Flex consumption model: Three new $1M+ Flex deals; new, more direct transaction model with customers being piloted more broadly in Australia later this year (partners still integrated).
  - Compliance/monetization: Continued non-compliance remediation; tightening concurrent use controls and in-product messaging contributing to incremental growth.
  - BIM evolution: Three-pronged approach—unlock data via APIs, enhance Revit performance/productivity, and reimagine BIM through cloud/outcome-based “augmented design” (Forma).
- Risks/challenges:
  - Macro continues to weigh on new subscriber adds.
  - FX headwinds.
  - M&E could be impacted if strikes persist.
  - China softness; construction and manufacturing customers still face hiring constraints.
  - Billing model transition creates FCF drag in FY24 and smaller drag in FY25.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Beat dynamics and guidance:
  - Largest recent beat driven primarily by earlier-than-expected EBA expansions/overuse (timing vs. stronger underlying than expected).
  - Revenue guide midpoint uptick reflects mix of organic and FX; change in CC growth at high end attributed to rounding.
- Billing transition/customer behavior:
  - Some customers shifting from multi-year to annual contracts; not a trend yet. No P&L impact; reduces unbilled RPO and total RPO growth but can improve upsell and removes multi-year price locks.
  - Systems and partner/customer behavior tracking as expected.
- EBA usage/expansion:
  - Early EBA billings driven by higher token consumption and customer budget/cash management; underlying usage strong; renewals still expected in Q4. Management did not quantify expansion opportunity.
- Construction strategy:
  - Combined sales teams to accelerate growth, especially in design accounts; no loss of business; customers value pricing predictability and design-make integration.
- Infrastructure:
  - ADCMS enables deeper engagement with DOTs; Autodesk differentiation in modern, cloud-based, integrated owner and lifecycle solutions across water/road/rail.
- M&E:
  - Business still growing but slowed in Q2; extended strikes would likely increase impact; overall exposure is modest.
- M&A:
  - Remains acquisitive where strategically aligned; lesson learned—integrate sales and back office faster.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Strong EBA usage and token consumption; ACC engagement up sharply; Fusion subs growing; direct and eStore channels strong; India a bright spot; China weaker; M&E softer.
- Cost/cash outlook: FX headwinds persist; FY24 cash taxes higher; Q3 FCF pressured by tax timing; 2H FCF skew to Q4; FY24 FCF trough reaffirmed.
- Capital allocation: Ongoing buybacks to offset SBC and opportunistically.
- Surprises vs expectations: Upside driven by earlier EBA usage/billings; otherwise fundamentals tracking in line; small observed shift to annual contracts noted but not yet a trend.

6) Takeaways
- Strong quarter with upside primarily from earlier EBA usage; overall business momentum stable despite macro.
- FY24 guidance tightened with higher lower bounds; EPS raised on higher interest income and lower downside risk; FY24 still the cash flow trough given billing transition.
- Strategic execution progressing: ACC engagement sharply higher; Fusion scaling; Flex consumption model gaining traction with new transaction model pilot.
- Watch items: FX headwinds; potential further customer shift to annual contracts (RPO optics); M&E strike duration; China softness; timing of infrastructure and water funding cycles.

7) Other Notable Information
- Government/industry programs: U.S. ADCMS program launched—expected to accelerate infrastructure digitalization discussions with DOTs.
- Compliance efforts: Continued progress converting non-compliant users (example: China-based auto designer to VRED/Alias 3-year subs).
- Recognition/ESG/Innovation: Named a Best Workplace for Innovators (Fast Company). Autodesk Foundation partnership highlighted (CoralMaker) as example of applying AI/robotics/design tools to sustainability initiatives.
- Rule of 40: Management reiterates long-term target of 45%+; balancing growth with disciplined FCF generation.
