- Macro/industry context:
  - Spend environment remains stable; T&E growth now broadly in line with goods & services.
  - Affluent U.S. consumer steady; international consumer growth stronger.
  - Dining is a key strategic category; restaurant spend remains one of the fastest-growing T&E categories for AXP.
  - Competitive dynamics in dining are “fierce,” but management sees structural advantages via premium customer base and merchant relationships.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q3 results:
  - Revenue: $16.6B, +8% YoY; 10th consecutive quarter of record revenues.
  - EPS: $3.49.
  - Billings (FX-adjusted): +6%.

  - Net card fees (FX-adjusted): +18% (accelerated 2 pts sequentially).
  - Net interest income (FX-adjusted): +17%.
  - Loans: +15% YoY; total loans and receivables growth +10%.
  - Credit: Delinquencies remain very low; write-off rate declined to 1.9%. Provision ~$1.4B, including $264M reserve build; reserve rate 2.9%.
  - Expenses: VCE-to-revenue ratio 41% (stable); rewards expense +10%; marketing ~$1.5B; operating expenses ~$3.8B (+5% YoY).
- Capital and liquidity:
  - CET1: 10.7% (within 10–11% target).
  - Capital return: $2.4B (buybacks $1.9B; dividends $0.5B). Shares outstanding reduced by 24M YoY.
  - High-yield savings balances +19% YoY; >75% from existing cardmembers; <10% penetration among U.S. consumers indicates runway.
- 2024 guidance:
  - Revenue growth: around 9% (unchanged range).
  - EPS: raised to $13.75–$14.05 (from $13.30–$13.80); implies ~23–25% YoY growth.
  - Marketing expense: ~ $6B for 2024.
  - Operating expenses: fairly flat YoY excluding the Assertify gain; slight seasonal uptick expected in Q4.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and product:
  - Product refresh cadence on track: 40 products refreshed globally YTD; several more expected by year-end.
  - U.S. Gold Card refresh (Q3 launch): enhanced dining benefits; new acquisitions running ~30% above Platinum; 80% of U.S. Gold card acquisitions from Millennials/Gen Z; early signs show strong acquisitions and high retention.
  - Dining ecosystem buildout:
    - Resi scaled to >50M registered users; ~350M diners seated in the last 12 months.
    - Recent acquisitions (Tock and Rooam) closed since Q2, expanding venues and capabilities (e.g., wineries/hotels/events; integrations; live event/stadium experiences).
    - Dining benefits embedded across Gold, Platinum, and refreshed premium Delta SkyMiles co-brands.
- Revenue mix and growth model:
  - Three “legs of the stool”: spend (discount revenue), NII, and card fees. Net card fees continue double-digit growth streak; NII growing but expected to moderate; spend growth stable at ~6%.
  - Long-term aspiration for ~10% revenue growth likely requires an acceleration in billings when macro strengthens.
- Credit and lending:
  - Lending growth primarily from premium, tenured customers (>70% of revolving growth); continue to expect modest upward bias in loss metrics as new customer vintages season and lending mix grows.
- Expense/investments:
  - Marketing, technology, and control investments elevated; management will continue to layer investments rather than “pulling forward” abruptly.
  - Rewards program evolving to improve redemption ease; small near-term increase in redemption rate with minimal long-term VCE impact.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Growth algorithm and 2025 EPS:
  - Mid-teens EPS growth seen as sustainable even if billings remain ~6%, given scale, continued acquisitions (3.3M new cards in Q3), fee growth, and NII.
  - Hitting 10% revenue growth would need faster billings; aspiration remains appropriate.
- Business development (partner payments) below expectations:
  - Lower than anticipated due to lower corporate client incentives tied to lower billings; no weather impact in guidance.
- Investment pacing:
  - Marketing up ~$800M YoY already; tech and control spend up. Hard to accelerate more in Q4; expect continued elevated investment in 2025.
- Spend per member and acquisition runway:
  - Average spend per member tempered by softer “organic” spend, particularly in small business; new cohorts show higher engagement (transactions per new cardmember up ~30% vs 5 years ago).
- Revenue cadence and discount revenue:
  - Q3 a reasonable proxy for Q4; discount revenue growth lagging billings partly due to international mix (lower discount rates).
- NII outlook:
  - Slightly liability-sensitive but Fed cuts have very small direct NII impact. Expect moderated AR growth, maintain strong yields, continue funding shift to HY savings.
- Fed easing and spend:
  - Too early to see impact; as cuts accumulate, could support confidence and organic spend.
- T&E details:
  - Airline spend steady; international travel bookings in Q3 reached highest since pre-pandemic.
  - Restaurant spend remains the fastest-growing T&E category; slight QoQ decel not seen as meaningful. Strategy supports continued share gains.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and disciplined. Emphasis on stability, strong earnings power, and long-term growth levers.
- Forward-looking:
  - Expect stable billings near-term; upside to aspiration contingent on macro improving organic spend (notably in small business).
  - Continued elevated marketing/tech/control investments; more product refreshes ahead.
  - Credit normalizing modestly but remains best-in-class due to premium selection and risk management.
  - Ongoing robust capital returns within CET1 range.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - EPS guidance raised despite revenues at lower end of range, implying better credit and operating leverage.
  - Business development expense came in lower due to incentive mechanics.

6) Takeaways
- EPS strength outpacing revenue: FY24 EPS raised to $13.75–$14.05 on stable 9% revenue growth, underscoring operating leverage and credit quality.
- Card fee engine accelerating: Net card fees +18% (FX-adjusted), supported by successful product refreshes and premium customer retention.
- Spend stable but sub-aspirational: Billings +6% FX-adjusted; hitting 10% revenue growth will likely require macro-driven acceleration in organic spend.
- Credit metrics resilient: Write-offs down to 1.9%, reserve rate steady at 2.9%; modest upward bias expected as portfolios season.
- Strategic focus on dining and premium: Resi/Tock/Rooam integrations and Gold refresh deepen differentiation with Millennials/Gen Z and drive long-term engagement.

7) Other Notable Information
- New cards acquired: 3.3M in Q3; strong retention, particularly among Millennials/Gen Z (higher loyalty vs older generations).
- International momentum: International Card Services billings +13% FX-adjusted; all top five markets in double-digit growth (Japan +17%, Mexico +15%).
- Rewards and benefits:
  - 300+ hotels added to The Hotel Collection; YTD bookings ~6x vs five years ago.
- Balance sheet/funding:
  - Diverse funding stack; increasing mix of high-yield savings (lowest funding cost) to support NII.
- Operational/regulatory:
  - Increased control investments as firm transitions from Category IV to Category III bank classification.
- Record revenue streak: 10th consecutive quarter of record revenues.
