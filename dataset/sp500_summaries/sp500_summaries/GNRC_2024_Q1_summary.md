- Guidance:
  - 2024 net sales growth: maintained at +3% to +7%.
  - Mix shift: slightly lower residential; slightly higher C&I vs prior outlook.
  - HSB shipments outlook unchanged; expect significant YoY growth as field inventory normalizes.
  - Residential product growth now low double-digit (prior mid-teens) on softer portables, energy storage/EV, and chore.
  - C&I products now mid- to high-single-digit decline (better than prior ~-10%) on stronger distributor channel.
  - Q2 2024 sales expected nearly flat YoY; acceleration in 2H.
  - Gross margin improvement: now +300–350 bps vs 2023 (raised from +300 bps); 2H GM ~200 bps above 1H.
  - Adjusted EBITDA margin: 16.5%–17.5% (unchanged); 2H margin ~450 bps above 1H (was ~600 bps prior).
  - Tax rate: GAAP 25%–26%; ~25% per remaining quarter.
  - Interest expense: $90–$93m (raised from $85–$90m).
  - Capex: ~3% of sales.
  - FCF conversion: ~100% of adjusted net income; weighted to 2H.
  - Guidance assumes baseline outages; no major event. A major outage could add $50–$100m shipments.

3) Management Commentary
- Residential
  - HSB: Shipments up mid-teens YoY; activations down modestly (mid-single digits) on softer outage environment. Shipments and activations aligned by Feb–Mar; field inventory destock largely complete. Dealer base ~8,800 (+100 QoQ). Ongoing investments in installers (dealer and non-dealer), sales tools, lead optimization, and category awareness.
  - Other residential: Continued softness in global portable generators (US and Europe), domestic energy storage and EV, and post-pandemic pressure in chore products.
  - Ecobee: YoY sales growth despite tough retail; strength with pros; higher connected homes and attach rate; gross margin improved meaningfully on cost reductions and component supply normalization.
  - Residential clean energy: Product quality improved; warranty upgrade program largely complete. DOE partnerships (Puerto Rico resiliency; Massachusetts GRIP program). Wallbox EV chargers begin shipping in Q2. Focus on integrating ecosystem (storage, inverters, EV charging, HSB, load control, thermostat) with a unified platform leveraging Ecobee UX/ML/AI.
- C&I
  - Industrial distributor channel: Significant shipment growth; resilient quoting and share gains; reduced lead times. Strategy strengthened by owned distribution in underrepresented geographies; natural gas gensets gaining share vs diesel in served markets.
  - Rental/telecom: As expected, soft and likely to remain so near term; long-term telecom secular growth intact.
  - Natural gas beyond standby: Moderately down on rates hurting ROI/timelines, but viewed as an important long-term opportunity; building multi-asset projects combining NG gens and new C&I storage.
  - International: Lower sales due to reduced intercompany Mexico-to-U.S. telecom shipments and weaker European portables; offset by Latin America strength. International adjusted EBITDA margin steady at 15%.

4) Q&A Highlights
- HSB shipments vs activations: Shipments up due to destock removal; activations modestly down on outages; alignment achieved by late Q1 suggests normalization.
- Data centers/AI: GNRC does not compete in ultra-large diesel backup; sees opportunities in edge data centers and potential natural gas backup where diesel permitting is difficult. Largest impact is indirect—grid strain and power quality degradation support demand for backup/resiliency across segments.
- C&I industrial distribution channel: ~70–75% of domestic C&I; project-driven (no channel stuffing); resilient demand across infrastructure, healthcare, manufacturing; ongoing share gains; supported by new Wisconsin factory and expanded R&D capabilities.
- Residential outlook: Destocking largely done; seasonality plus normalized shipments support 2H ramp; hurricane season could be active, but guidance assumes baseline outages.
- Energy Technology outlook (to 2026): Near-term softer on NEM 3.0 and rates; GNRC’s next-gen residential storage (late 2024) and rooftop solar inverters (early 2025) still on track; expects market normalization as inventory clears and rates eventually ease.
- Gross margin drivers: Faster realization of lower steel and freight costs, better plant efficiencies, and favorable HSB mix; de-risks 2H margin expansion.
- Competitive landscape: A key competitor moving under PE ownership; GNRC believes scale and continued investment improving share, especially in HSB. Residential HSB penetration ~6.25%—significant runway.
- Portables/chore: Portables weak domestically on outages and sharply lower in Europe as energy security fears fade; chore products pressured by channel overhang and weak snow season.
- R&D/Opex: R&D up materially (energy tech focus: storage, inverters, platform integration); Opex modestly higher to support strategy, offsetting part of GM upside; EBITDA margin guide unchanged.
- Input costs sensitivity: Steel largest driver; copper less material with lagged impact.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on execution, cost control, and long-term secular tailwinds; cautious near term on rental/telecom and non-HSB residential categories.
- Demand trends: HSB demand supported by normalized channel, seasonality, and baseline outages; C&I distributor momentum solid; energy tech improving product roadmap with ecosystem integration.
- Cost outlook: Input costs improving faster than expected; continued GM expansion through mix, cost, and price.
- Capital allocation: Stronger FCF restores optionality; leverage trending down; no buybacks/M&A assumed in guide.
- Surprises vs expectations: Q1 beat on GM and C&I shipments; raised GM outlook; mix shift in guidance; interest expense higher.

6) Takeaways
- Home standby recovery on track: Channel destock largely complete; shipments/activations aligned; mid-teens HSB shipment growth supports 2H acceleration.
- Mix and cost drove margin beat: 490 bps GM expansion on HSB mix, lower steel/freight, and better plant efficiency; elevated GM outlook de-risks 2H.
- C&I resilience: Industrial distributor channel strong with share gains and shorter lead times, offsetting rental/telecom softness; better full-year C&I outlook.
- Residential headwinds outside HSB: Portables, energy storage/EV, and chore products softer than planned, trimming residential growth to low double digits.
- Long-term secular tailwinds intact: AI/data centers, electrification, and grid constraints favor GNRC’s resiliency portfolio; integrated energy tech platform a medium-term growth vector.

7) Other Notable Information
