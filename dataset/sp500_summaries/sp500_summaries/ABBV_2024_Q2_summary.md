*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)
- Period: Q2 2024 (fiscal year 2024)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Broad-based strength across the ex-Humira growth platform (immunology, oncology, neuroscience), with immunology outperforming.
  - Aesthetics market growing but below prior expectations in the U.S. and China due to economic headwinds; partial reversal of Q1 inventory destock aided Q2.
  - U.S. IRA implications: management supports Part D redesign but views price-setting as harmful to innovation; modeling already incorporated in outlook.
  - Pending Cerevel acquisition expected to close soon (no divestitures anticipated).

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q2 results:
  - Revenue: ~$14.5B (+5.6% operational; -1.3% FX), ~$450M above guidance.

    - Rinvoq: ~$5.7B (+$100M).
    - Venclexta: ~$2.5B (+$100M).

- Q3 2024 guidance:
  - Revenue: ~$14.2B (FX ~-1.3%).
  - Adjusted EPS: $2.92–$2.96 (excludes IPR&D).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Immunology leading: Skyrizi and Rinvoq combined sales >$4.1B in Q2; ~50% operational growth in year 5 on market. UC approval for Skyrizi adds new leg of growth; robust IBD momentum (Crohn’s and UC).
  - Oncology: Strength in Venclexta; Elahere uptake aided by OS data and NCCN updates; Epkinly expanding with U.S. FL approval, EU decision expected 2024.
  - Neuroscience: Double-digit growth in Vraylar, Ubrelvy, Qulipta; Botox Therapeutic solid, esp. chronic migraine. ABBV-951: U.S. CRL tied to third-party manufacturing (not safety/efficacy); launches ongoing in JP/EU, U.S. timeline TBD.
  - Aesthetics: Global +2.8% operational; U.S. +4.4% with share leadership intact; China softer. New indications (China masseter, potential U.S. platysma) and innovations (Voluma XC temple, short-acting toxin “Bonte” filing late 2024) to drive long-term growth.
  - Business development: Nearly a dozen early-stage deals YTD to seed next-decade growth (immunology, oncology, neuroscience). Cerevel integration expected soon.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Humira erosion continuing; U.S. access parity to biosimilars still for a majority in 2024 but lower in 2025.
  - Aesthetics near-term macro softness; moderated 2024 outlook.
  - IRA price-setting provisions remain a sector headwind.

4) Q&A Highlights
- 2025 outlook:
  - Return to “robust” revenue growth (above industry low-single-digit baseline) despite Humira and Part D redesign (~3% growth headwind).
  - EPS expected to grow in line with revenue: operating margin expansion (SG&A leverage/efficiencies) offset by full-year interest expense from Cerevel/ImmunoGen financing.
- Immunology dynamics:
  - Skyrizi/Rinvoq: Low single-digit price erosion expected; strong and stable access; Medicare Part D dynamic separate.
  - Humira access: 2024 parity ~three-quarters of lives; 2025 expected “meaningfully lower,” around half of lives (management will update post contracting).
  - Physician switching trend: A portion of patients moving from adalimumab (including biosimilars) to new mechanisms (Skyrizi/Rinvoq), observed acutely in CVS exclusion cohort and more broadly across markets; net positive for ABBV mix long term.
  - IBD strategy: Skyrizi front-line positioning; Rinvoq later-line “backstop.” Cannibalization modest; synergy across sales/medical. Platform combo studies to raise IBD efficacy ceiling (e.g., TL1A, α4β7 add-ons to Skyrizi).
- Aesthetics:
  - U.S. facial injectables traffic improving mid-single-digit; below prior expectations; pricing/promotional efficiency to aid H2 (e.g., fewer competitive launch promos; seasonal events).
  - Q1 destock partially reversed in Q2; remaining unwind expected around H2 promotional peaks (e.g., Botox Day/Juvederm Day).
- Oncology pipeline:
  - Teliso-V (c-Met ADC) BLA for NSCLC (c-Met overexpressing, EGFR WT) to be filed Q3 under RTOR; BTD granted; 2025 approval decision expected; confirmatory Ph3 ongoing.
  - ABBV-400 (next-gen c-Met ADC): Ph3 in 3L CRC to start 2024; lung cancer Ph2 planned after encouraging Ph1 signals.
  - ABBV-383 (BCMA×CD3): Ph3 mono in 3L MM started; combos to move into earlier lines in 2025; aim for outpatient-friendly, low CRS profile.
- Neuroscience:
  - ABBV-951: U.S. CRL unrelated to product; working with FDA/CMO on timing.
  - Aβ antibody ABBV-916 discontinued as monotherapy (insufficient differentiation).
  - Cerevel: No expected divestitures; close possible as early as next week. Late-2024 readouts for emraclidine (schizophrenia) and tavapadon (Parkinson’s).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking:
  - Ex-Humira growth platform on pace for nearly $6B of FY24 growth; immunology and neuroscience momentum to continue into 2025; Skyrizi UC and ABBV-951 (pending U.S.) incremental contributors.
  - Humira headwind lessening in absolute dollars vs. 2024; Part D redesign manageable within robust growth.
  - Aesthetics long-term target ($9B in 2029) reaffirmed; near-term moderated but supported by low global penetration, innovation pipeline, and marketing muscle.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Guidance raised again; immunology outperformance and oncology strength offset aesthetics moderation.
  - Clearer color on Humira parity (2024 ~75%; 2025 ~50%) and physician switching to new mechanisms.

6) Takeaways
- Immunology engines Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to outperform, with IBD becoming a major growth pillar; UC approval for Skyrizi and strong Crohn’s momentum drive market share gains.
- 2024 guidance raised on core strength; 2025 set up for “robust” revenue growth despite Part D and Humira, with EPS tracking the top line as margin expansion is offset by financing costs.
- Aesthetics near-term softer than expected (U.S./China), but leadership intact and long-term growth target unchanged, supported by new indications and differentiated short-acting toxin.
- Oncology pipeline catalysts (Teliso-V, ABBV-400, ABBV-383) and Epkinly label expansion underpin medium/long-term growth beyond immunology.
- Cerevel closing imminent with no divestitures expected; bolsters neuroscience pipeline and diversification; continued early-stage BD builds next-decade growth runway.
