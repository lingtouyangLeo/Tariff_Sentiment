1. Quarter & Company Context
- Company: CooperCompanies (CooperVision and CooperSurgical); Ticker: COO
- Fiscal period: Q1 FY2024
- Context/macro:
  - Contact lens market remains robust with ongoing mix shift to silicone hydrogel dailies and rising adoption of toric and multifocal lenses; pricing environment remains positive.
  - Myopia prevalence expected to reach ~50% of global population by 2050 (from ~34% today), supporting long-term demand for vision correction and myopia management.
  - Fertility market tailwinds intact globally (delayed childbirth, awareness, coverage expansion, better tech and access). U.S.-specific IVF headlines (e.g., Alabama) not seen as altering underlying global growth.
  - FX is a headwind in FY24, especially in Q2.

2. Headline Financial Results
- Q1 results (non-GAAP unless noted):
  - Revenue: $932M (record), +9% reported, +8% organic
    - CooperVision (CVI): $622M, +7% organic; regional growth: Americas +6%, EMEA +10%, APAC +7%
    - CooperSurgical (CSI): $310M, +8% organic; Fertility $119M, +11% (13th consecutive double-digit quarter)
  - Gross margin: 67.3% vs. 65.7% (+160 bps YoY), driven by efficiencies and pricing at both divisions
  - Operating margin: 24.4% vs. 22.6% (+180 bps YoY) on GM expansion and SG&A leverage
  - Non-GAAP EPS: $0.85, +18% YoY (note: 4-for-1 stock split in prior week; ~200M average shares); FX -$0.03 YoY impact
  - Free cash flow: $5M (Capex $118M; elevated for capacity expansion)
  - Net debt: $2.6B (reflecting Nov. acquisition of Cook labor & delivery assets)
- Guidance (FY2024):
  - Consolidated revenue: $3.85–$3.90B, +7–8% organic (raised)
  - CVI revenue: $2.57–$2.60B, +8–9% organic (raised)
  - CSI revenue: $1.27–$1.29B, +5–7% organic (raised)
  - Non-GAAP EPS: $3.50–$3.58, +9–12% reported; +15–17% constant currency (raised)
  - Interest expense: ~$108M (assumes no Fed rate changes); Tax rate: ~14.5% ETR; FX: ~-1% to revenue and ~-5% to EPS for full year

3. Management Commentary
- CVI growth drivers:
  - Daily silicone hydrogel up 14% (MyDay, clariti); FRP silicone hydrogels up 6% (Biofinity, Avaira Vitality)
  - MyDay family highlights:
    - Multifocal: strong momentum; easy-fit system with 98% fit in ≤2 pairs
    - Toric: parameter expansion in NA/EU; industry-leading SKU range; leveraging Biofinity toric design
    - Energys: nearing 1-year in U.S.; “digital boost” resonates with heavy screen time users
  - Biofinity toric multifocal seeing strong uptake; expanding availability and entering new markets
  - Capacity expansion: improving; easing supply constraints, enabling more active product/geographic rollouts; expectation to return to double-digit CVI growth as early as Q2
- Myopia management:
  - Segment revenue $29M (+19%); MiSight up 51% with strength in EMEA; ortho-K down 10% on China weakness (choppy)
  - SightGlass (JV with EssilorLuxottica): FDA Breakthrough Device designation; targeting U.S. approval in 2H CY2025; JV currently loss-making below OI
  - Launching digital tools/programs to streamline MiSight fitting; “Generation Sight” pilot to provide care to underserved U.S. children
- CSI:
  - Fertility: continued double-digit growth driven by consumables, capital, and reproductive genetic testing; ongoing investments (donor sites, training, geographic expansion, innovation)
  - New products/tech: Witness IQ (cloud platform for Witness lab tracking); primary template-directed amplification for embryo biopsy (first major DNA amplification advance since 2009); continued AI use in embryo selection
  - Office & Surgical: $191M, +6% organic; medical devices +6% (Cook L&D +13%), stem cell storage +4%, Paragard +7% (benefiting from mid-single-digit price increase)
  - Commitment to access and reproductive rights emphasized

4. Q&A Highlights
- Contact lens market:
  - Pricing: low single-digits (2–3%) with mix-led uplift from dailies/toric/multifocal; limited pushback so far
  - Toric/multifocal remain underpenetrated globally; significant multi-year runway
  - Daily penetration still early; long growth runway in users and value mix
- Capacity/supply:
  - Material improvement; still some constraints (noted in Japan/APAC) but better positioned to support existing customers and launch activity; confidence in potential double-digit CVI growth from Q2
- CVI guidance raise:
  - Strong Q1 close, February trends, capacity gains underpin move from 7–9% to 8–9% organic; management sees pathway to double-digit growth in remaining quarters
- Margins:
  - FY gross margin expected roughly similar to last year (as reported); Q2/Q3 worst FX headwinds; operating margin up YoY (more on constant currency)
- CSI growth pace (5–7%):
  - Some conservatism; Paragard volume growth challenged and potential generic competition (not yet approved) incorporated; if competitor delayed, potential upside
- Myopia management:
  - TAM likely “billions of dollars”; spectacles expected to be first-line therapy for children; contact lenses complementary—compliance considerations could drive higher CL penetration in myopia-managed patients
- Ortho-K:
  - Globally growing, but China volatile; expects choppiness though full-year growth possible
- Cash/capex:
  - FCF to inflect in 2H; capex as % of sales similar to last year in FY24, then down over time
- Regulatory:
  - Inquiry on LDT rule changes deemed not applicable to Cooper’s current business
- Reporting change:
  - MiSight now included in “Sphere” within CVI reporting; consolidation better reflects business and competitive dynamics

5. Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident; demand strong; capacity improving; guidance raised early in the year
- Forward-looking:
  - Expectation for CVI acceleration (potential double-digit from Q2); CSI steady with fertility strength and cautious stance on Paragard competition
  - FX headwinds (especially Q2/Q3) noted; no assumed rate cuts
  - Continued investment in high-return projects (capacity, geographic expansion, innovation)
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Early guidance raise across revenue and EPS; gross/operating margin outperformance in Q1; Paragard better than feared near term as competitor not yet approved

6. Takeaways
- Broad-based strength: Record revenue, margin expansion, and raised FY24 guidance; CVI poised to accelerate as capacity improves.
- Mix tailwinds: Shift to daily SiHy, toric, and multifocal lenses plus pricing support CVI growth and margin resilience despite FX.
- Myopia momentum: MiSight up 51%; digital tools and key-account adoption progressing; SightGlass breakthrough designation builds U.S. pathway (target 2H CY2025).
- CSI durable growth: Fertility continues double-digit trajectory; innovation (Witness IQ, genetic testing tech) and Cook L&D assets contributing; Paragard remains a watch item (pricing helps; generic risk persists).
- Financial discipline: FX headwinds and higher capex near term, but operating leverage improving; FCF expected to inflect in 2H.

7. Other Notable Information
- 4-for-1 stock split completed; ~200M average shares in Q1
- JV accounting: SightGlass JV results recorded below operating income (currently a loss; expected to turn profitable post-approval and scale)
- ESG/CSR: Continued progress highlighted; >15,000 employees
- Program launch: “Generation Sight” U.S. pilot with three optometry schools to expand pediatric myopia care access
- Product naming/portfolio:
  - MyDay Multifocal, MyDay Toric (parameter expansions), MyDay Energys; clariti (daily SiHy family); Biofinity toric multifocal availability expanding; Avaira Vitality
- FX guide cadence: Q2 worst quarter for FX impact on profitability; full-year FX still ~-1% revenue and ~-5% EPS impacts
