1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)
- Period: Q4 2024 and Full-Year 2024; 2025 outlook provided
- Context highlighted by management:
  - Navigating a heavy LOE period (Revlimid ongoing step-downs; Pomalyst EU/US pressure; Abraxane; others), with growth brands now >50% of revenue in Q4.
  - U.S. Medicare Part D redesign materially changes gross-to-net phasing in 2025 (notably for Eliquis), with Q1 softness, H2 strength.
  - IRA pricing framework remains a policy overhang; BMS will push for fixes (small-molecule “penalty” and spillover effects).
  - Strategic pivot toward a younger, diversified growth portfolio; re-entry into neuroscience via Cobenfy (KarXT) acquisition and rapid development ramp.
  - Enterprise-wide productivity/efficiency programs to fund growth and lift margins; expanded savings now intended to drop to bottom line.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q4 2024 (non-GAAP, underlying)

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and execution
  - Growth Portfolio execution: double-digit FY growth led by Camzyos (mavacamten), Breyanzi, Reblozyl, Opdualag; momentum in Sotyktu despite rebate headwinds; Eliquis demand robust.
  - Neuroscience platform: Cobenfy (KarXT; schizophrenia) launched in U.S.; broad late-stage expansion plan with multiple Phase 3 starts in 2025 (AD agitation, AD cognition, bipolar I); ASD irritability to follow.
  - Immuno-oncology durability: Opdivo subcutaneous (Opdivo Qvantig) approved; intend to convert 30–40% of IV volume ahead of 2028 LOE to extend the franchise into the 2030s.
  - R&D productivity: accelerated timelines (e.g., Camzyos Odyssey NHCM enrollment finished 6 months early; ADEPT2 in AD psychosis pulled forward to 2H25; iberdomide MM trial adding MRD as co-primary for earlier potential readout).
- Cost discipline and structure
  - Expanded savings program: +$2B incremental run-rate Opex savings (roughly 50% org redesign/50% operational efficiency); ~$1B in 2025, remainder by 2027. Unlike the initial $1.5B program (mostly reinvested), the incremental $2B is set to drop to the bottom line.
  - Ongoing focus on becoming leaner/more agile while prioritizing high-ROI growth investments.
- Portfolio/product updates
  - Camzyos: standard of care in obstructive HCM; continued strong new patient adds (~1,300 in Q4); EU label already eased echo frequency in maintenance (q6 months post week 12). U.S. PDUFA in April for similar REMS easing. NHCM Odyssey topline expected Q2 2025.
  - Eliquis: strong U.S. demand; expect full-year double-digit growth in 2025 but with Q1 trough and H2 skew due to Part D redesign.
  - Sotyktu: improved access (80% covered lives with zero step edits), but higher rebates will temper 1H reported sales.
  - Cell therapy: Breyanzi continued strong growth; Abecma remains important amid intensifying competition; GPRC5D CAR-T (ArloCell) advancing as a post-BCMA option.
  - Radiopharma (RAISE Bio): Phase 3 in GEPNETs (post-Lutathera) reads in 2026; SCLC Phase 1 ongoing; GPC3 program starting; BD interest remains.
- Pipeline catalysts
  - 2025: multiple registrational readouts (including Cobenfy ARISE adjunctive schizophrenia; ADEPT2 AD psychosis 2H25; Camzyos NHCM Odyssey Q2).
  - 2026: key first-/best-in-class opportunities (milvexian in ACS and secondary stroke prevention; admalparant LPA1/IPF; mezigdomide MM; ArloCell GPRC5D CAR-T MM; RAISE101 GEPNETs).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Cobenfy launch/ramp: ~1,000 weekly TRx; Medicaid >90% access, Medicare >80%; majority with one step-edit; commercial progressing. Physicians starting at 50 mg, slower titration than trials; GI AEs manageable; BID dosing not a barrier in context of high pill burden. Demand expected to build through 2025, accelerating H2.
- Cobenfy expansion/R&D: seven Phase 3 starts across AD agitation/cognition and bipolar I in 2025; ASD irritability next; ADEPT2 (AD psychosis) pulled forward to 2H25; ARISE adjunctive schizophrenia readout “in a few months.” Management argues real-world background use and 52-week emergent data support confidence in adjunctive setting.
- Part D redesign: Net neutral across portfolio expected in 2025. Eliquis benefits from elimination of coverage gap; Q1 lowest quarter, H2 > H1. Offsetting headwinds for Revlimid/Pomalyst/Camzyos/Sotyktu as patients enter catastrophic phase (BMS now picks up manufacturer responsibility).
- Opdivo Qvantig (subcutaneous): Early prescriber feedback positive (3–5-minute administration, patient/clinic burden reduction). Conversion slower 1H due to temporary J-code; accelerates post-permanent J-code (effective July 1). Expect low single-digit growth for Opdivo + SC combined in 2025; plan 30–40% IV-to-SC conversion pre-LOE.
- Cost program durability: Expanded $2B savings positions BMS well through LOE cycle; always aligning spend to business needs; priority remains investing for growth.
- Guidance delta vs. consensus: Management notes ~$0.5B FX headwind is a key factor; otherwise broadly aligned. Trough earnings still anticipated in late 2020s; aim to lessen depth/duration via growth execution, BD, and pipeline acceleration.
- BD philosophy: Senior leadership-led capital allocation; science-led and financially disciplined; Cobenfy (Karuna) cited as model deal. Appetite remains to strengthen core TAs and growth profile.
- Immunology rebates: Better access for Sotyktu in 2025 but higher rebates temper 1H reported sales.
- Multiple myeloma:
  - Iberdomide: MRD added as co-primary (FDA engaged); earlier readout possible in 2025; PFS remains co-primary; regulatory acceptability will hinge on magnitude and totality of data.
  - Mezigdomide: head-to-head vs. pomalidomide ongoing; long-term plan includes replacing older IMiDs where appropriate.
- Yervoy: Sustained growth from IO combo indications; 10-year melanoma data; near-term launches in 1L HCC and 1L MSI-H CRC with Opdivo; pending China lung combo approval.
- Policy: BMS ready to engage new Congress and Administration (referenced President Trump’s incoming administration); push for IRA adjustments (small-molecule timeline “penalty,” spillover).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and execution-focused; candid on LOE and Part D impacts, with clear plans to offset via growth engines, cost takeout, and BD.
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Eliquis: continued strong demand and share; double-digit 2025 growth with favorable Part D dynamics by H2.
  - Cobenfy: strong early receptivity; significant long-term opportunity post-competitor setback; heavy investment in label expansion.
  - Opdivo franchise durability via SC conversion and guideline inclusion; temporary coding headwind easing mid-year.
  - Camzyos: steady expansion; U.S. REMS easing (PDUFA April) expected to open COE capacity; NHCM could expand population ~30%.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Acceleration of key readouts (ADEPT2, iberdomide, Odyssey).
  - Decision not to commercialize syndacumab; ceased pursuing Zeposia in UC following Crohn’s miss.
  - Expanded $2B savings all to bottom line.

6) Takeaways
- Growth engines gaining share: Growth portfolio >50% of Q4 revenue; strong momentum in Camzyos, Breyanzi, Reblozyl, Opdualag; Eliquis remains robust despite Part D shifts.
- Neuroscience platform now central: Cobenfy off to a solid start with broad, accelerated Phase 3 expansion that could drive meaningful mid- to long-term growth.
- IO durability strategy in place: Opdivo SC conversion targeted at 30–40% pre-2028 LOE; early feedback positive; reimbursement mechanics improve after July.
- Cost and capital discipline: Expanded $2B Opex savings to lift margins; continued debt paydown; BD remains top capital priority to shape back-half decade growth.
- Near-term headwinds manageable: Legacy LOEs, Part D gross-to-net, and Q1 destock pressure 2025 phasing, but H2>H1 and EPS guided to $6.55–$6.85.
