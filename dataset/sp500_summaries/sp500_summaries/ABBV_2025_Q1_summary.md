1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie (ABBV); Fiscal Q1 2025
- Context/tone: Strong operational performance across core franchises; raising FY guidance. Management repeatedly flagged U.S. trade policy risk (potential pharma sector tariffs) not embedded in guidance, and broader policy overhangs (IRA implementation, 340B reform, PBM reform, possible DTC advertising limits, EU pricing dynamics). Aesthetics remains macro-challenged. Company emphasizes large U.S. manufacturing footprint and >$10B planned U.S. capex over next decade; expects high-single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029 and a clear runway for at least eight years of growth.

  - Revenue: ~$15.0B (FX -0.3% on FY growth).
  - Adjusted operating margin: ~49.5%.
  - Adjusted EPS: $3.26–$3.30 (ex-acquired IPR&D).

3) Management Commentary
- Commercial performance:
  - Immunology: $6.2B; Skyrizi + Rinvoq combined $5.1B (+65%); strong IBD momentum. In U.S. Crohn’s, Skyrizi+Rinvoq capture ~50% of “in-play” patients; UC in-play share ~33% (Skyrizi leading). Skyrizi gaining in psoriatic disease; Rinvoq growing across rheum and AD; prepping GCA label expansion (EU approved; U.S. expected soon).
  - Humira: $1.1B (-49.5% op); below expectations on faster share erosion and further molecule compression; FY U.S. guidance cut; 2026 expected to be fourth year of erosion with tail stepping down.
  - Oncology: $1.6B; ahead of expectations. Imbruvica $738M (-11.9%) amid CLL competition; Venclexta $665M (+12.3%). Solid tumor portfolio emerging: Elahere $179M; Teliso-V (CMET-ADC) U.S. approval/commercialization expected in coming months.
  - Aesthetics: $1.1B (-10.2% op), in line; Botox Cosmetic $556M (-10.7%); Juvederm $231M (-20%). Persistent macro headwinds; moderating category growth assumptions and lowering FY aesthetics guidance. Bonti (fast-acting, short-duration toxin) filed in U.S.; targeted to activate new patients and possibly be combined/co-formulated with Botox longer term; U.S. launch expected 2026.
  - Neuroscience: ~$2.3B (+17% op), all key brands ahead. Vraylar $765M (+10.3%); Botox Therapeutic $866M (+17%); Ubrelvy $240M (+18%); Qulipta $193M (+48%); VYALEV (Parkinson’s) $63M with strong OUS uptake; U.S. ramp to build with Medicare coverage. Tavapadon (D1/D5 agonist) Phase 3 data supportive; U.S. filing 2025, launch 2026.
- Pipeline and BD:
  - Immunology combos: Skyrizi with multiple mechanisms (ludecizumab; anti-CD40 gravagalumab; TL1A next-gen; α4β7; TREM-1). Multiple Phase 2 starts; first combo readouts expected 2026. Head-to-head Skyrizi vs Sotyktu (psoriasis) data this year; Rinvoq P3 readouts in alopecia areata and vitiligo this year; EU Rinvoq GCA approved; U.S. decision near.
  - Oncology ADCs: Teliso-V accelerated approval anticipated Q2 for high c-MET NSCLC; TMAB-A next-gen c-MET ADC moving into frontline combos and other indications with early data at ASCO; ABBV-706 (SCLC, target SES6) shows ~60% ORR in early study; advancing to R/R and frontline combo with PD-L1 to seek chemo-sparing regimens. Venclexta MDS P3 data on track this year; PIVOT/“PIVAC” in BPDCN filing planned 2025. ABBV-383 (BCMA x CD3) P3 monotherapy in late lines enrolling (full enrollment early 2026); combo data starting 2026 for earlier lines.
  - Obesity: Gubra-partnered long-acting amylin (ABBV-295) interim MAD Part 1 positive (6 weeks): at 2 mg weekly, mean -7.8% weight vs +2% placebo (BMI ~24 cohort); good tolerability (mainly appetite suppression). MAD Part 2 testing higher doses, overweight/obese cohorts, 12-week dosing, titration, and longer intervals (q2w/monthly) leveraging ~270-hr half-life; full data expected 2026; Phase 2b to follow. AbbVie plans further obesity investments; acquired Nimble Therapeutics (oral peptides) and licensed Gubra amylin to deepen pipeline.
  - Psychiatry: Imraclidine (M1 agonist) path reevaluation—new MAD study in 2025 to explore higher exposure; potential stepwise return via Phase 2 in mono/adjunct schizophrenia and neurodegenerative psychosis pending data.
- Manufacturing/footprint: 11 U.S. sites with >6,000 workers; Skyrizi made in U.S. for domestic market. Adding four new U.S. plants; >$10B U.S. capex over next decade (API, biologics, peptides, devices). Significant OUS presence retained, including Ireland; footprint geared for supply assurance and demand growth.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Tariffs/policy:
  - Potential U.S. pharma sector tariffs not in guidance; mitigations could include inventory management, alternative API sources, cost/productivity moves, and long-term U.S. capacity adds. Passing costs through seen as difficult given government/commercial contracts.
  - Current tariffs: aesthetics modest impact (~$30M), absorbed in guidance; China reciprocal tariffs also contemplated and modest; no notable recent China demand shift.
  - Broader policy: supportive of patient affordability (PBM reforms), elimination of IRA “pill penalty,” and EU better valuing innovation; cautioned against international reference pricing. Discussed 340B reform recommendations as constructive. DTC restrictions viewed as uncertain—company could pivot to disease education and other channels if needed.
- Immunology dynamics:
  - Skyrizi/Rinvoq guidance raises driven by IBD (Skyrizi +$400M), psoriasis (+$200M), and balanced Rinvoq growth (+$300M across rheum/derm/IBD). Pricing for Skyrizi/Rinvoq slightly negative for FY; Q1 saw minor favorable gating (copay optimization, channel mix timing).
  - Competition: IL-23 class share growth in psoriasis a precedent for IBD expansion; management confident category growth is not zero-sum and in-brand profiles support continued share gains.
  - Humira tail: faster erosion in 2025; expect further step-down in 2026 (year 4 post-LOE). Diminishing corporate headwind from 2026 onward.
- Aesthetics:
  - Market headwinds persist; lowered 2025 category assumptions. U.S. toxin share lost in 4Q recovered ~1 point in Q1; plan to rebuild further in 2025. Fillers share stable in U.S.; China gaining share in both toxins and fillers on new indications (Masseter, Volux).
  - Bonti pricing: to be determined; could price for trial/activation benefits given short duration but offset by high practice lifetime value of new patients. Combo/co-formulation with Botox could yield a “near-immediate acting Botox-like” premium option longer term.
- Obesity strategy:
  - Amylin seen as monotherapy opportunity and base for combinations; focus on tolerability, durability, body composition. Neutral pH formulation facilitates co-formulation. Exploring multiple combo partners (GLP-1 and others not ruled out).
- One-offs:
  - No material retail destock headwind in Q1 (benefit vs typical pattern). No notable inventory build/pull-forward in I&I beyond modest retail inventory effects.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Broad-based strength in Immunology (Skyrizi/Rinvoq), Neuroscience (Vraylar, CGRP, Botox Therapeutic, Vyalev), and Hematologic Oncology (Venclexta). Aesthetics remains weak on macro; guide moderated.
- Cost/margins: Maintaining robust margin framework (FY adj. op margin ~46.5%) despite increased R&D to fund pipeline.
- Capital allocation: Continued U.S. manufacturing investments; active BD in five core areas plus obesity; oncology ADC pipeline ramping.
- Surprises vs expectations: Topline/EPS beat; sizable raises to Skyrizi/Rinvoq and several oncology/neuro products; larger-than-expected Humira erosion; aesthetics guide cut as anticipated. Confident tone on long-term growth, with tariff caution.

6) Takeaways
- Skyrizi/Rinvoq are the primary growth engines, with accelerating IBD momentum; FY guidance raised meaningfully for both.
- Humira erosion running faster than planned in 2025; tail expected to step down again in 2026 but becomes a less material corporate headwind thereafter.
- Aesthetics under macro pressure; FY guide reduced, but Bonti filing positions AbbVie to expand the funnel and potentially reshape the toxin segment via rapid-onset/combination strategies.
- Oncology franchise is building a second pillar: Elahere performing well; Teliso-V approval imminent; next-gen ADCs TMAB-A and ABBV-706 showing promise; Venclexta steady; 383 bispecific advancing.
- Policy/trade risks are real but not in guidance; AbbVie’s sizable U.S. footprint and planned investments provide mitigation. Management tone confident on delivering HSD revenue CAGR through 2029 and maintaining a long growth runway.
