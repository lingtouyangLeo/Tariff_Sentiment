Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII)
- Period: Q1 2024
- Macro/industry context:
  - Residential channel destocking nearing completion; distributor inventories near normal.
  - Regulatory refrigerant transition (R410A to low-GWP R454B/A2L) approaching; 2024 largely R410A, with A2L ramping in 2025.
  - Residential new construction rebounding; mixed signals on repair vs. replace.
  - Commercial: Replacement demand strong; some deceleration and project delays in new construction. Company remains more supply than demand constrained.

Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: $1.0B, up 6% YoY.
- Adjusted EPS: $3.47, up 23% YoY.
- Adjusted segment margin: 15.9%, up ~160 bps YoY (record Q1).
- Cash flow: Operating cash outflow of $23M (vs. $79M use in prior year).
- Segment performance:
  - Home Comfort Solutions (HCS, residential): Revenue $681M (-1% YoY); price +3%; two-step distribution volumes down mid-teens (destock), direct-to-contractor volumes up low-single digits; segment margin 16.6% (+~30 bps) and profit +$1M to $112M.
  - Building Climate Solutions (BCS, commercial & refrigeration): Revenue +21% (volume +7%, price/mix +8%, AES acquisition +6%); segment margin 21% (+480 bps); profit +56% YoY; includes ~$2M ramp headwind for Saltillo, Mexico.
- Guidance:
  - FY24 revenue growth ~7% (volume: slight increase in BCS, flat in HCS; price/mix mid-single digits; price-cost positive).
  - FY24 adjusted EPS raised to $19.00–$20.00 (from $18.50–$20.00).
  - Free cash flow: $500–$600M (unchanged).
  - Capex: $175M; interest expense ~$50M; tax rate ~20%.
  - Cost outlook: Component cost inflation mid-single digits; higher R410A acquisition costs; some commodity (steel, copper, aluminum) inflation; partially offset by material cost reductions.
  - One-time/ramp costs in 2024: ~$10M (Saltillo ramp) and ~$5–$10M (HCS refrigerant transition).

Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives:
  - Distribution transformation: Decentralized structure with five regional P&Ls; enhanced revenue operations, pricing excellence, and distribution management; network analysis and WMS rollout; improved fulfillment rates; NPS practices implemented; 45% of residential sales via LennoxPros.com.
  - Refrigerant transition: Designs/manufacturing finalized; low-GWP (R454B) shipments begin later in 2024; >10% price increase on new A2L products; expect 50–65% A2L mix of end market in 2025.
  - Capacity expansion: New Saltillo, Mexico plant to start output in early Q3; Stuttgart, AR production improving; flexibility to balance between plants; long-term potential to double commercial capacity over 5+ years.
  - Pricing excellence: Continued actions to lift under-market legacy contracts, localized pricing authority, and aim to stay price > cost as inflation persists.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Weather uncertainty into peak season.
  - Manufacturing inefficiencies during line conversions (A2L) and initial Saltillo ramp.
  - New construction deceleration and potential project delays in commercial.
  - EPA timing on component cutoff dates creates inventory planning ambiguity.
  - Metals and refrigerant cost inflation; 410A price dynamics still evolving.

Q&A Highlights
- Distribution KPIs: Management is focused on fulfillment rate and NPS as near-term proof points; pricing excellence evident in results.
- Seasonality: Q1 ~20% of revenue; FY revenue 1H/2H roughly 50/50; Q1 included a warranty benefit that won’t repeat; incremental costs step up in Q2/Q3 for ramps/transitions.
- Destocking: Leading indicators (e.g., universal coils) and distributor feedback support view that destocking is ending; expect indirect channel units up in Q2 (weather caveat).
- A2L adoption and pricing: 2025 A2L mix at 50–65% driven by 2024-built 410A sell-through and component allowances; expect ~10%+ price uplift on A2L for both resi and commercial; 410A pricing flatter than expected YTD but likely to rise into 2025; 410A manufacturing costs to increase as volumes decline.
- HCS price/mix cadence: Q1 captured only partial impact of Feb/March price actions; mix pressure from RNC rebound should moderate; additional benefit later in year from prior SEER changes.
- BCS demand/margins: Company views segment as capacity constrained; replacement demand strong; emergency replacement share a key share-gain opportunity; absent ramp costs, margins would trend modestly higher; typical ~30% incrementals on volume.
- Working capital: Expect ~$50M inventory build in 2024 (R410A pre-build in HCS and BCS plus Saltillo raw materials); raw inventory otherwise trending down as supply chains heal.
- M&A and leverage: Open to industry consolidation; focused on HVAC with bolt-on pipeline; could lever to slightly above 3x for the right deal, then delever quickly; maintaining investment-grade ratings is priority.
- Earnings quality: Recurring items (asbestos, environmental, certain litigation) now included in adjusted results; ~25c y/y headwind vs prior presentation approach.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends:
  - HCS: New construction improving; repair/replace watch item; sell-in expected to improve as destocking abates; limited A2L adoption late 2024.
  - BCS: Replacement-led order rates/backlog healthy; new construction slower with some delays; national accounts receptive to integrated offerings post-AES.
- Cost outlook: Mid-single-digit component inflation; metals inflation emerging (steel immediate, copper/aluminum via 18-month hedge); price actions to protect margins.
- Capital allocation: Capex prioritized (Saltillo and digital/distribution), dividends grow with earnings, bolt-on M&A, opportunistic buybacks, IG rating intact.
- Surprises vs. expectations: Record Q1 margins; BCS margins at 21%; raised EPS midpoint; explicit A2L adoption/pricing roadmap; improved adjusted earnings quality.

Takeaways
- Strong start to 2024: Revenue +6%, EPS +23%, record Q1 margins; guidance midpoint raised on improved visibility.
- Commercial momentum: BCS growth and 21% margins underscore pricing power and replacement demand; Saltillo ramp is a 2H catalyst with manageable start-up costs.
- Residential stabilization: Destocking near end; pricing initiatives gaining traction; mix headwind from RNC should moderate; A2L pricing provides 2025 tailwind.
- Execution/investment cycle: Multi-year distribution and pricing programs progressing; near-term costs for plant ramp and refrigerant transition are known and guided.
- Watch items: Weather, project delays in commercial new construction, metals and refrigerant inflation, line-conversion inefficiencies, and EPA timing impacts on inventory.

Other Notable Information
- Low-GWP transition operational details: New piping/storage/testing infrastructure for mildly flammable A2L refrigerants; temporary line shutdowns during conversions; most investments already on the floor.
- Segment mix details: AHRI rooftop growth strong; Lennox grew equal or better on rooftops; refrigeration volume softer in Q1.
- Digital and service ecosystem: 45% of residential sales via LennoxPros.com; expanding diagnostic/monitoring tools and “cradle-to-grave” services with AES integration.
- Balance sheet: Net debt to adjusted EBIT at 1.4x (vs. 2.1x prior year); flexibility for bolt-ons and potential larger transactions.
- Reporting change: Inclusion of recurring asbestos/environmental/litigation costs in adjusted results improves earnings quality (estimated ~25c y/y headwind under new approach).
