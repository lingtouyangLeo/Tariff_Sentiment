Management Commentary
- Strategy/product:
  - Post-cloud innovation ramp with EFX.ai, single data fabric, Ignite; 14% vitality with multi-data solutions.
  - “Twin Indicator” (Work Number income/employment signal) embedded in mortgage pre-qual credit file; strong lender interest; to be provided at no incremental cost to differentiate file and drive share.
  - Twin Indicator launches for Auto and Personal Loan targeted in H2 2025; NC Plus telco/utility attributes added to mortgage credit file.
  - Government: New integrated “Complete Income” solution (Work Number + consumer-permissioned bank transaction/gig/self-employed income) launching Q3 to support evolving verification mandates.
- Data scale:
  - Work Number (TWN): Active records 198m (+10% YoY); total 767m; 4.6m contributing employers (+1.3m YoY); 4 new partnerships YTD; “current records” 113m (+9%), “current SSNs” 100m (+8%).
- Regulatory:
  - SSA amendment (~$50m ACV) enabling monthly income/employment verification for disability eligibility recertification.
  - FHFA maintained tri-merge; Equifax supports access-to-credit and data-driven risk management.
  - VantageScore: Equifax has access via JV; adoption in mortgage seen as complex and multi-year; too early to assess pricing/impact.

Notable Risks, Challenges, Competitive Pressures
- Mortgage: Continued volume weakness and high volatility; H2 inquiries guided down >13%.
- Hiring/Talent: Soft US hiring; white-collar particularly weak; recent slowdown in transactions amid tariff/interest-rate uncertainty.
- Government: Near-term state-level budget/funding variability from changed federal/state cost-sharing; contract timing causing volatility; visibility improving medium term with new mandates.
- Litigation/Costs: Higher consumer litigation and small-claims volume industry-wide; elevated costs expected through H2; could remain high near term.
- Competitive/market: Background screening “court records” revenue impacted by share shifts among screeners (low margin). Potential future mortgage score competition (Vantage vs FICO) but timing uncertain.
- FX: Mild revenue drag, slight margin dilution.

Q&A Highlights
- EWS Government: Headwinds tied to 2024 changes in state/federal reimbursement; effects vary by state; flexible contracting (including subscriptions) to bridge budget cycles. Medium-/long-term outlook strengthened by new federal rules (semi-annual redeterminations, work requirements, SNAP error-rate accountability) and federal program opportunities (IRS EITC, Do Not Pay portal, SSA, Education, Labor).
- USIS Mortgage: Pre-qual share gains fueled by Twin Indicator pipeline and NC Plus; adoption requires lender workflow changes; broader ramp expected into late 2025/2026.
- Mix/pricing: Broad 1/1 price increases across businesses; outsized mortgage growth buoyed by third-party score pass-through; USIS margin expansion tempered by higher-mortgage mix and continued NPI investment.
- Talent: Hiring weakness persists; background screening “court records” decline due to a customer loss at a client that shifted to a provider not using Equifax; low profit impact; core incarceration dataset growing.
- International: LatAm strong (Brazil/Boa Vista); Europe/APAC resilient; Canada soft on macro/tariff rhetoric; margins rising as cloud migrations complete.
- Guidance stance: “Balanced” given tariff/interest-rate uncertainty and intra-quarter mortgage volatility despite strong H1.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Non-mortgage USIS: Auto remains strong; FI expected to improve in Q3; offline marketing (pre-screen) healthy; no spike in portfolio reviews (no broad credit deterioration signal).
  - EWS Consumer Lending: Very strong demand, especially personal loans, benefiting from record growth.
  - Government: H2 growth similar to H1; multi-year tailwinds from policy changes and federal program opportunities.
- Costs/capital allocation:
  - Elevated litigation costs near term; overall 2025 EBITDA margin about flat vs 2024.
  - Accelerated FCF; continued buybacks in H2; dividend increased.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: Q2 revenue/EPS beat (mortgage pre-approval strength, slightly better mortgage volumes, solid non-mortgage); raised vitality outlook; USIS FY growth upgraded.
  - Negative: Higher corporate litigation costs; EWS FY growth trimmed on hiring/government near-term softness; maintained cc guidance for H2 despite strong H1.

Takeaways
- Strong Q2 beat with record revenue and EPS leverage; innovation benefits from cloud (14% vitality) driving share gains, especially in mortgage pre-qual.
- Maintaining constant-currency FY outlook given mortgage volatility, hiring softness, and tariff/rate uncertainty; reported guidance raised modestly on FX.
- EWS near-term growth tempered by state budget dynamics and hiring softness, but policy changes and new government programs create multi-year tailwinds.
- USIS outlook improved (mortgage +13% FY) with continued margin expansion; International steady at ~7% cc growth with rising margins post-cloud.
- Litigation costs are a real near-term headwind at corporate; FCF and capital return are ramping with $3B buyback program and higher dividend.
