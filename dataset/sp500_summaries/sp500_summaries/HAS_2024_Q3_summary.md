1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Hasbro, Inc. (HAS)
- Period: Q3 2024 (earnings call)
- Context/Macro:
  - Management continues to pivot mix toward games, digital, and IP licensing (the “future of play”).
  - Toy industry ex–building blocks tracking down roughly 2%–5% YTD; holiday expected to remain modestly down in that range. Retailer support for Hasbro heading into holiday described as solid.
  - Inventory discipline remains a priority; inventories at multi-year lows and down ~40% YoY.

2) Headline Financial Results

  - Revenue: $1.3B, down 15% YoY; down 9% ex-E1 divestiture.
  - Adjusted operating profit: $329M; margin 25.7%, up 290 bps YoY.
  - Adjusted net income/EPS: $244M; $1.73, up $0.09 YoY.
  - Cash/Short-term investments: $1.2B (includes May debt proceeds; earmarked to repay Nov-2024 notes).

- Segment Detail
  - Wizards of the Coast & Digital: Revenue -5% YoY (lapping Baldur’s Gate 3); Magic: The Gathering +3%. Margin 44.9% (down ~300 bps YoY) on lower licensed digital gaming volume. Monopoly Go royalties contributed and are stabilizing.
  - Consumer Products (CP): Revenue -10% YoY (exited brands, sharply lower closeouts, softer volume incl. Star Wars). Margin 15.1%, up 390 bps YoY on favorable mix, supply chain productivity, fewer closeouts, and lower expenses.
  - Entertainment: Revenue -86% YoY (E1 divestiture). Ex-divestiture, down 17% (deal timing).
- Year-to-Date (YTD) 2024
  - Revenue: ~$3.0B, down 18% YoY; down 8% ex-E1.
  - Adjusted operating profit: $726M; margin 23.9% (up ~1,000 bps YoY).
  - Adjusted EPS: $3.56.
  - Operating cash flow: $588M, up $253M YoY.
- 2024 Guidance (updated)
  - Wizards: Revenue flat to -1% (raised from -1% to -3% prior); operating margin ~42%. Q4 will step down on tough Magic comps/set timing.
  - Consumer Products: Revenue down 12%–14% (worse vs prior down 7%–11%); margin 4%–6% (unchanged). Q4 margin to step down sequentially (higher royalty mix; lapping prior-year expense actions) but up YoY versus last year’s clean-up period.
  - Entertainment (ex-E1 impact): Revenue down ~$15M YoY; margin ~60% (unchanged).
  - Cost savings: On track for $750M gross by 2025; $200M–$250M net in 2024. Through 9 months: $240M gross, $177M net.
  - Adjusted EBITDA: Unchanged at $975M–$1.025B.
  - Ending cash: Expected above year-end 2023.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic progress:
  - Games and licensing (Wizards, consumer products licensing) driving margin expansion; CP profitability improving despite lower revenue.
  - Out-licensing strategy outperforming (FurReal Friends, Littlest Pet Shop POS >50% YoY).
- Brand updates:
  - Magic: Growth in Q3 (Bloomburrow, Dustmourne), strong backlist & Secret Lair; Arena engagement up. December Secret Lair x Marvel drops expected to sell out; larger Marvel “Spider-Man” set coming in 2025; Final Fantasy set in June 2025; a third Universes Beyond collaboration also planned.
  - Dungeons & Dragons: Updated 5e Player’s Handbook is fastest-selling D&D product ever (50% above plan). D&D Beyond DTC now 60% of D&D mix; registered users ~19M.
  - Monopoly Go (Scopely): Settling at ~$10M/month royalty revenue to Hasbro; innovations include third-party content (Marvel) and Tycoon Club web program (lower platform fees benefit Hasbro’s net royalty base).
  - Toys/CP: Play-Doh best back-to-school ever (+~20% POS); top SKUs gaining placement. Beyblade X acceleration post media and anime launch; Marvel momentum (Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men ’97, Spidey preschool). Star Wars action figures soft. Board games pipeline cited across family/strategy/adult segments.
- Operations:
  - Closeout volumes deliberately reduced (~-70% YoY) to protect margins; “good toy” (non-discounted) Q4 volume expected flat to up.
  - Organizational changes: CP global brand and commercial teams unified under Tim Kilpin; design function further integrated with Asia supply chain/product development to speed time-to-market and improve efficiency.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Monopoly Go trajectory:
  - Despite third-party download data, Hasbro sees healthy UA, stabilized decay rates, and strong engagement/re-engagement. Marketing spend at high end of 25%–35%; $105M 2024 revenue maintained. Web store/Tycoon Club reduce platform fees, positive to Hasbro royalties. 2025 expected flat to up vs 2024; plus one additional quarter above MG thresholds next year.
- CP guidance cut drivers:
  - Midpoint ~-$100M vs prior: ~50% fewer closeouts (by choice), ~30%–40% from entertainment-backed brands (primarily Star Wars), remainder execution challenges amid leaner inventory/tighter planning.
  - POS outlook largely unchanged; non-discounted volume flat to up in Q4; discounted volume significantly down.
- CP margins:
  - No one-timers in Q3. Q4 margin step-down driven by higher royalties (brand mix) and lapping lower prior-year managed expenses.
- Exited brands:
  - Q3 impact ~2 points (~$20–$25M); similar in Q4. In 2025, these become higher-margin royalties versus prior in-house economics.
- Wizards Q4 softness:
  - Driven by Magic set timing (lapping 2023 LotR holiday set; January set shipping later vs prior year). Margin step-down entirely due to revenue deleverage; digital roughly flat YoY (BG3 last year vs Monopoly Go this year).
- Baldur’s Gate 3:
  - 2024 contribution ~$35M; expected multi-year tail (Larian’s model: limited discounting, special editions/content drops), albeit below 2024 peak.
- Industry POS:
  - Toys ex–building blocks down low-single digits YTD; holiday to mirror trend. Hasbro POS ex-divested brands down high-single digits YTD, expected to improve in Q4 with more newness, promos, and better shelf execution.
- Cost savings mix:
  - 2024 skewed ~60% supply chain; 2025 expected ~50/50 supply chain vs opex. Design-to-value savings begin impacting P&L next year.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking tone:
  - Confident on margin durability, cash flow, Wizards health (Magic/D&D), Monopoly Go steadiness, and licensing momentum. Cautious on CP top-line near term (Star Wars softness, fewer closeouts, execution within lean supply).
  - Expect continued CP stabilization into Q4 and foundation for profit growth into 2025–2026.
  - Capital allocation: invest in core, sustain dividend, reduce leverage (repay Nov-2024 notes).
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: Wizards guidance raised; CP margins materially better despite sales pressure; BG3 tail stronger than expected; D&D PHB record performance; inventory sharply down.
  - Negative: CP revenue guide lowered (closeouts pullback, Star Wars action figures); Wizards Q4 decline larger due to set timing.

6) Takeaways
- Hasbro’s mix shift is working: Wizards and licensing drove a third straight quarter of margin expansion; CP margins improving even as revenue declines.
- 2024 guidance mixed: Wizards raised (flat to -1%), CP lowered (-12% to -14%) with margin range intact (4%–6%); EBITDA outlook unchanged.
- Strong IP momentum: Magic growth continued; D&D Beyond scaling DTC; Monopoly Go royalty stream stabilizing at ~$10M/month with levers to sustain into 2025.
- Operational discipline: Inventory at multi-year lows; closeouts sharply reduced to protect margins; supply chain productivity and cost savings tracking ahead.
- Near-term watch items: Q4 Wizards decline on set timing; action figures (notably Star Wars) softness; execution within tighter inventory model; holiday POS in a modestly down industry.

7) Other Notable Information
- Organizational realignment: CP global brand and commercial teams combined under Tim Kilpin; design integration with Asia supply chain to accelerate speed-to-market and efficiency.
- Licensing/out-licensing:
  - Out-licensed toy brands (e.g., FurReal Friends, Littlest Pet Shop) showing >50% POS growth YTD; expects improved royalty flow-through in 2025 vs modest MG recognition in 2024.
  - LEGO collaborations (Peppa Duplo, Icons Bumblebee) and My Little Pony resurgence across categories.
- Upcoming content pipeline:
  - Magic x Marvel Secret Lair drops in December (limited runs; typically low to mid-single-digit millions per drop) and larger Marvel “Spider-Man” set in 2025; Final Fantasy in June 2025; another Universes Beyond set planned for late 2025.
  - Film tailwinds: 2025 Captain America and Fantastic Four; 2026 Disney slate buildup (per management commentary).
- Events: MagicCon Las Vegas cited as the largest yet with product announcements.
- Balance sheet/debt: May financing completed; plan to repay Nov-2024 notes; year-end cash expected above 2023.
