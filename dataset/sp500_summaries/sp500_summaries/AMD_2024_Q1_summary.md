3) Management Commentary
- Strategic/Products:
  - Data Center GPUs: MI300X is fastest-ramping product in AMD history; surpassed $1B cumulative revenue in <2 quarters. 2024 Data Center GPU revenue outlook raised to >$4B (from $3.5B).
  - Large cloud deployments (Microsoft, Meta, Oracle) for training/inference; >100 enterprise/AI customers developing/deploying MI300X. Multiple OEM platforms entering volume production.
  - Software: Added upstream support in OpenAI Triton; major ROCm update (VLLM, JAX, video decode, FP8, sparsity, attention optimizations). Partners report leading inference throughput and TCO vs H100 on flagship LLMs.
  - Server CPUs: EPYC Genoa gaining share; enterprise adoption accelerating (American Airlines, DBS, Emirates NBD, Shell, STMicro). Oracle Exadata now exclusively on 4th-gen EPYC.
  - Next-gen EPYC “Turin” (Zen 5) sampling broadly; “silicon looks great”; 30% more platforms vs prior gen; launch later in 2024; expands SAM in cloud/enterprise.
  - Client/AI PC: Strong Ryzen 7000/8000 momentum; Ryzen Pro 8000 launched (first on-chip AI accelerator for commercial desktops). Next-gen “Strix” mobile (later 2024) targeting premium; >150 ISVs building for AMD AI PCs.
  - Embedded/Adaptive: Versal Gen2 Adaptive SoCs (3x AI TOPS/Watt; 10x scalar); Subaru adopting for EyeSight ADAS. Spartan UltraScale+ launched.
  - Networking/Systems: Active in Ultra Ethernet Consortium; partnering with Broadcom, Cisco, Arista; building full rack-scale reference designs.
- Risks/Challenges:
  - Near-term supply tightness for AI systems components (industry-wide) despite AMD’s growing supply; Gaming demand weak with 2H below 1H; Embedded recovery only gradual in 2H.

4) Q&A Highlights
- MI300 demand/supply:
  - Demand strengthening; broader customer ramp from POCs to pilots to production; building backlog. Q2 demand > supply; full-year >$4B outlook is not supply-capped; AMD has visibility to supply beyond $4B.
  - Profitability: MI300 gross margin currently below Data Center CPU level; expected to be accretive to corporate average over time as yields/test improve; elevated R&D spend temporarily pressures Data Center operating margin.
- Roadmap/Competitiveness:
  - Multi-year, multi-generational GPU roadmap beyond MI300; increased co-development with top AI customers; flexible chiplet architecture; emphasis on full systems (compute, interconnect, networking).
  - Ethernet viewed as long-term networking answer; AMD can scale systems prior to standards finalization via partnerships.
- Server CPUs:
  - EPYC pricing stable; value proposition driven by TCO/Perf-per-Watt, especially high-core counts.
  - Enterprise demand improving; cloud 1P/3P workloads expanding; Turin transition expected to be faster than prior gen due to platform continuity; EPYC revenue to grow through 2024 with share gains.
- PCs/AI PCs:
  - Q2 Client up QoQ; in 2H both units and ASPs expected to improve; initial AI PC strength skewed to premium (Strix).
- Gaming/Embedded:
  - Gaming notably weak; Q2 down >30% QoQ; 2H gaming lower than 1H; gaming margins below corporate average (mix tailwind).
  - Embedded: Q1 decline worse than expected in comms/industrial/auto; Q2 flat; 1H is the bottom; gradual 2H recovery.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking:
  - Strong confidence in AI compute cycle durability; AMD increasing investments across AI hardware/software roadmaps and GTM.
  - Data Center GPU revenue raised to >$4B in 2024; continued quarterly supply ramps; not full-year supply constrained.
  - Turin (Zen 5) CPUs and Strix AI PC chips in 2H expected to extend leadership and drive share gains.
  - Gaming to remain a headwind; Embedded inflects gradually in 2H.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: MI300 revenue raise; continued strong enterprise server momentum; margin expansion trajectory.
  - Negative: Gaming outlook softer than typical seasonality; Embedded weaker in Q1 with slower recovery.

6) Takeaways
- AI momentum accelerating: MI300X is scaling rapidly with >$4B 2024 GPU outlook; strong customer traction across cloud and enterprise; software stack progress improving performance and ease of adoption.
- Data Center mix drives margins: Gross margin expanding with Data Center/Client mix; GPUs accretive to corporate GM over time; elevated AI R&D temporarily weighs on Data Center operating margin.
- CPUs remain healthy with share gains: EPYC enjoys enterprise strength and cloud adoption; Turin (Zen 5) later this year widens SAM and should ramp faster due to platform continuity.
- PCs stabilizing with AI uplift: Client up QoQ in Q2; Strix to target premium AI PC segment; AMD expects client revenue share gains in 2024.
- Headwinds persist in Gaming/Embedded: Gaming down significantly in Q2 and 2H < 1H; Embedded bottoming in 1H with gradual 2H recovery; both temper near-term consolidated growth but aid mix as Data Center scales.
