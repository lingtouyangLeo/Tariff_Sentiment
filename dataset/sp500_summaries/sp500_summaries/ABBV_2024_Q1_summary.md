1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)
- Period: Q1 2024
- Context/Industry:
  - U.S. Humira biosimilar competition continues; 2024 dynamics driven largely by price, with parity access preserved for the significant majority of lives.
  - CVS formulary change effective Apr 1; some Humira switches are moving to other MOAs (including Skyrizi and Rinvoq), not only to biosimilars.
  - IRA Part D benefit redesign creates a revenue headwind in 2025 (most concentrated in Immunology and Oncology); impact moderates thereafter.
  - Aesthetics normalizing seasonality (Q2 and Q4 strongest); China macro headwinds expected to persist near term with H2 recovery anticipated.
  - Leadership transition: CEO Rick Gonzalez to Executive Chair on July 1; Rob Michael to CEO.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q1 Results:
  - Revenue: $12.3B (+1.6% operational; -0.9% FX), ~$400M above guidance.
  - Adjusted EPS: $2.31, $0.11 above guidance midpoint (includes $0.08 unfavorable acquired IPR&D).
  - Adjusted operating margin: 42.2% (GM 82.9%; R&D 14.7%; IPR&D 1.3%; SG&A 24.6%).
  - Adjusted tax rate: 14.8%. Net interest expense: $429M.
  - Ex-Humira growth platform up >15%; Skyrizi +48% op; Rinvoq +61.9% op; Venclexta +16.3% op; Vraylar, Ubrelvy, Qulipta double-digit growth.
  - Humira: ~$2.3B (-35.2% op), erosion consistent with plan; Q1 U.S. slightly better than expected.
- FY24 Guidance (raised):
  - Adjusted EPS: $11.13–$11.33 (raised $0.16; includes $0.42 dilution from ImmunoGen closed + pending Cerevel).
  - Revenue: ≈$55B (raised $0.8B); FX -0.9% headwind.
  - Product assumptions:
    - Skyrizi: $10.7B (+$0.2B)
    - Rinvoq: $5.6B (+$0.1B)
    - Imbruvica: $3.1B (+$0.2B; lower erosion)
    - Elahere (to AbbVie): $450M (+~$0.2B; partial year)
  - P&L: GM ≈84%; R&D ≈14%; SG&A ≈23.5%; operating margin ≈46.5%; net interest ≈$2.2B.
- Q2 Guidance:
  - Revenue: ≈$14B; FX -1.3%.
  - U.S. Humira erosion ≈32% YoY (step-up in volume erosion from CVS change partially offset by one-time price dynamic).
  - Adjusted operating margin ≈49.5%; tax 16.4%; adjusted EPS $3.05–$3.09.
  - Guidance excludes future IPR&D.

3) Management Commentary
- Portfolio/Strategy:
  - Ex-Humira growth platform driving performance; diversified growth pillars: Immunology (Skyrizi/Rinvoq), Neuroscience (Vraylar, migraine), Oncology (Venclexta, Elahere), Aesthetics (Botox/Juvederm).
  - M&A/BD: ImmunoGen closed (Elahere accelerates solid tumor entry); Cerevel expected mid-2024 close (tavapadon in PD, emraclidine in schizophrenia). Added early-stage deals: Landos (NLRX1 agonist), OC Immunotherapeutics (ChemR23 agonist), Parvus (tolerization platform), Tentarix (multispecifics).
- Product/Pipeline updates:
  - Immunology: Skyrizi momentum across psoriasis, PsA, CD; UC approvals expected mid-2024 (U.S.) and 2H24 (EU). Rinvoq Level Up H2H vs. Dupixent showed superiority on composite efficacy; positive Phase 3 in Giant Cell Arteritis; strong IBD uptake (mid/high-teens in-play share in UC/CD).
  - Oncology: Elahere received full FDA approval (FRα+ platinum-resistant ovarian cancer) with OS benefit; NCCN guideline upgrades supportive. Epcoritamab (Epkinly) 3L+ DLBCL launch progressing; potential FL label expansion in 2024. Navitoclax MF program discontinued. ABBV-383 (BCMA bispecific) moving to Ph3 in 3L MM; potential best-in-class profile.
  - Neuroscience: Qulipta (prevention) leadership emerging; Ubrelvy acute strong; Botox Therapeutic solid in chronic migraine. ABBV-951 (to be branded Vialeve) for advanced PD: EU/JP launches encouraging; U.S. approval expected 2024.
  - Aesthetics: U.S. facial injectables share stable; Voluma XC approved for temple hollows; platysma prominence Botox indication expected late 2024; short-acting toxin (Bonti) NDA 2H24; expect high single-digit global aesthetics growth in 2024.
- Risks/Challenges:
  - U.S. Humira erosion continues; PBM/formulary dynamics (e.g., CVS template) managed through parity strategy/multi-year contracts.
  - 2025 IRA Part D redesign a multi-point revenue headwind; offset by growth drivers and margin expansion; interest expense annualization moderates EPS growth vs revenue.

4) Q&A Highlights
- 2025 outlook: Management expects robust revenue growth despite Part D redesign and further Humira erosion; EPS growth solid but tempered by interest expense annualization from ImmunoGen/Cerevel; acceleration in both revenue and EPS from 2026 onward.
- Humira dynamics: 2024 decline still mostly price; volume erosion contemplated (CVS, potential interchangeable impact). Notably, a meaningful portion of Humira RX is switching to other MOAs (including Skyrizi/Rinvoq). Majority of lives remain parity in 2024; no expectation of widespread new exclusions. Humira “tail” likely emerges in 2025 with more visibility in 2026.
- Aesthetics Q1 softness: ~>$50M inventory drawdown (≈2/3 Botox, 1/3 Juvederm) due to shifting promotions into Q2; underlying market share and demand tracking to plan; expect normalization in Q2. China aesthetics flat for 2024 with H2 recovery expected.
- Skyrizi UC opportunity: UC smaller than CD but still multi-billion; strong bio-naïve data expected to drive rapid uptake, leveraging CD success. JAK class U.S. label constraints likely persist absent new outcomes data; ex-U.S. earlier-line use may expand.
- PBM/policy: No expectation for wholesale PBM structural reform near term; transparency reforms possible.
- Cerevel: No overlapping MOAs; minimal schizophrenia overlap for Vraylar; expect FTC clearance and close mid-2024.
- Elahere: Full-quarter industry sales ~$113M; AbbVie recognized $64M post-close. Majority use currently in platinum-resistant; guideline changes could broaden use; monitoring off-label is difficult but growth runway remains.
- Royalties: Skyrizi cash royalty payment ~$400M in Q1 (timing lag vs quarterly sales).

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Positive:
  - Top-/bottom-line beat; FY revenue and EPS guidance raised; Ex-Humira platform >15% growth.
  - Clear articulation of 2025 IRA impact and post-2025 acceleration; continued operating margin expansion.
  - Strong H2 catalysts: Skyrizi UC approvals, ABBV-951 U.S. approval, Epkinly FL label, aesthetics innovation.
  - Elahere OS data and full approval support solid tumor growth optionality.
- Caution:
  - 2025 EPS growth to lag revenue due to interest expense annualization.
  - Ongoing Humira formulary/volume risks; contracting season dynamic through year-end.
  - China aesthetics macro remains a headwind near term.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Aesthetics underperformance tied to inventory timing (quantified), not share/demand; Humira volume tracking as planned with notable switch to other MOAs.

6) Takeaways
- AbbVie delivered a clean Q1 beat and raised FY guidance; growth is broad-based across Immunology, Neuroscience, and Oncology, with Humira erosion well-managed.
- Skyrizi/Rinvoq remain powerful growth engines; UC approval for Skyrizi is a major 2024 catalyst, with Rinvoq showing compelling H2H and new GCA data.
- Elahere integration is smooth; full approval and guideline upgrades underpin a meaningful solid tumor growth leg; additional oncology milestones in 2024.
- 2025 will absorb IRA Part D headwinds and higher interest expense, but management still expects robust revenue growth; acceleration in growth beyond 2025.
- Aesthetics fundamentals intact; Q1 weakness was timing/inventory. Expect normalization in Q2 and high single-digit growth for 2024 despite China softness.
