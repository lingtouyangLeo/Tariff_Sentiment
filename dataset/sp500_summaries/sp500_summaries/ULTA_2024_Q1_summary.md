3) Management Commentary
- Strategic stance: Confident in long-term model; not satisfied with recent prestige share trends; taking action to reaccelerate growth and defend/expand share.
- Five near-term growth priorities:
  1) Assortment/newness: >25 new brands in 2024; balance of growth drivers (e.g., Sol de Janeiro, Charlotte Tilbury, Naturium) and exclusives (e.g., Wynn by Serena Williams, Orabella by Bella Hadid). Expanding distribution of key brands (e.g., Charlotte Tilbury now in ~600 stores; MAC expanding). Ulta Beauty Collection relaunch this summer; planned markdowns in Q1 ahead of relaunch.
  2) Social relevance: Scale creator/influencer network; amplify brand collaborations; increase share of voice/EMV across TikTok/Instagram; be at the center of beauty’s cultural conversation.
  3) Digital experience: Completed digital store transition; enhance SEO and discovery via buying guides, guided navigation, innovative search; accelerate app adoption (app users spend ~2x); launched on DoorDash Marketplace (access to 70M+ users).
  4) Loyalty: Rebranded to Ulta Beauty Rewards; 43.6M members (+6% YoY) with strong retention and upgrades to Platinum/Diamond; mobile POS to drive signups/engagement; testing gamification; new martech to deepen personalization later this year.
  5) Promotions: Elevate tentpoles (semi-annual Beauty Event, Spring Haul, summer event planned); increase targeted offers; eliminate low-ROI promos; run Member Love events to drive engagement and basket.
- Operations/people: Digital platform decommission in Q2; Project SOAR ERP live in all primary DCs and ~30% of stores; improved associate retention across stores, DCs, and corporate.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Outlook/comp cadence: Q2 comps expected to be similar to Q1 (~low-single digits). 2H acceleration predicated on initiatives/newness and easier compares; guidance embeds flexibility to invest in marketing, promos, and store labor to protect share.
- Margin framework: Top-line is key to fixed-cost leverage; with comps below 3–5% long-term algo, margin leverage is tougher. Last year’s merchandise margin ~200 bps above 2019, but now pressured by higher promos/mix. More long-term financial detail to come at October Analyst Day.
- Competitive dynamics: Unprecedented prestige distribution expansion (in-store/online) driving store-share pressure; ULTA maintained total beauty share; outpaced mass; lost prestige share in stores but gained in prestige e-comm. Promotional environment elevated but rational; no clear brand-specific promo trend linked to distribution expansion.
- Category color:
  - Makeup: Down mid-single digits; pressure from increased distribution, tough lapping of social virality, and some newness underperforming. Expect to improve with expanded CT/MAC and exclusives (e.g., Wynn), plus mass partners (e.g., elf, NYX).
  - Fragrance: Double-digit growth; newness (e.g., exclusive Cosmic by Kylie) and seasonal gifting (Valentine’s).
  - Skincare: Mid-single-digit growth; strong body care and mass skincare; prestige skincare down.
  - Hair: Low single-digit growth, aided by tools and event positioning.
  - Services: High single-digit comp growth.
- Inventory: Growth mainly from new brands/new stores and MFC; largely core/current; markdown risk limited beyond planned Ulta Collection relaunch (mostly 1H).
- Monthly cadence: March strongest (Beauty Event + Easter timing); April positive but softer due to Easter shift.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand: Traffic positive in stores and online; app penetration rising; loyalty base growing with record “brand love.”
- Costs/margins: Will protect sales-driving investments; shrink remains a watch item (improving in fragrance, higher in other prestige); promo elevated vs LY but planned and targeted; 2H GM expected to stabilize/firm modestly.
- Capital allocation: Strong cash generation supports consistent buybacks (~$1B planned FY24); ongoing store openings.
- Surprise vs. expectations: FY24 outlook reduced despite in-line internal Q1 EPS; cautious stance on 1H pressures; confidence in 2H improvement without implying a hockey stick.

6) Takeaways
- Q1 delivered modest top-line growth with margin compression from promos, deleverage, and shrink; EPS down YoY.
- Competitive pressures in prestige (more doors/online access) are real, pressuring store share; ULTA held total beauty share and gained prestige e-comm share.
- Management is leaning into newness, social/creator activation, digital upgrades, loyalty personalization, and refined promotions to reaccelerate growth.
- FY24 guidance lowered: comps 2–3%, OM 13.7–14%, EPS $25.20–$26; Q2 comps similar to Q1; 2H better on initiatives and easier compares.
- Balance sheet and cash returns remain solid; ERP/digital transformations largely on track; inventory healthy and positioned for upcoming launches.

7) Other Notable Information
- DoorDash Marketplace launch broadens last-mile reach.
- Tentpole events: semi-annual Beauty Event and Spring Haul drove traffic; summer event planned; ongoing multi-week “Member Love” program by category.
- Ulta Beauty Collection relaunch slated for summer (Q1 markdowns in preparation).
- Project SOAR: all primary DCs live on new ERP; ~30% of stores migrated; legacy digital platform to be decommissioned in Q2.
- Prior-year (FY23) extra week (+$181.9M sales, +$0.46 EPS) complicates YoY comparisons.
