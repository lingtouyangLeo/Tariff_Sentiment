*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV); Fiscal period: Q4 2024 and full year 2024; Call also included 2025 outlook
- Industry/macros:
  - Humira U.S. loss of exclusivity drove ~$5B erosion in 2024; ongoing U.S. molecule compression shifting volume to novel mechanisms (benefiting Skyrizi/Rinvoq)
  - Medicare Part D benefit redesign a ~4% headwind to 2025 revenue growth, with modest volume offsets
  - Aesthetics market challenged by U.S. inflation-driven consumer pressure and China macro weakness; obesity drugs are a near-term wallet headwind but longer-term funnel tailwind
  - No significant LOE events for AbbVie for the rest of the decade

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic/portfolio positioning:
  - Rapid return to sales growth in second year post-Humira LOE; ex-Humira platform driving results
  - Skyrizi + Rinvoq expected ~+$6B growth in 2025 to nearly $24B; updated 2027 combined sales >$31B (+$4B vs prior)
  - Neuroscience: $10B expected in 2025 (+$1B YoY) across psychiatry, migraine, Parkinson’s; strong interest in VYALEV; Tavapadon Phase 3 positive, filings planned after LT safety
  - Oncology: building an ADC/bispecific-led solid tumor and heme portfolio (Teliso-V, ABBV-400/TMAB-A, ABBV-706; ELAHERE scaling; Venclexta expanding)
  - Aesthetics: near-term headwinds (U.S., China), but long-term low-penetration tailwind; reverted to original Allē loyalty program after Q4 misstep; long-term CAGR high-single digits 2025–2029
  - Eye care: focused on glaucoma, retinal disease, Rx dry eye; upside optionality from Regenxbio gene therapy for wet AMD/DR
- Pricing/market access:
  - Skyrizi/Rinvoq: consistent low single-digit annual net price declines (rebates); 2025 impacted by one-time Part D redesign; growth primarily volume-driven
  - Humira: 2025 U.S. sales ~$4B; more plans moving to biosimilar exclusivity mid-year; ~half of U.S. covered lives expected to maintain parity access for FY25 (with some exclusions mid-year)
- Business development:
  - >20 early-stage deals since early 2024 across immunology, oncology, neuroscience; Immuno-combo strategy (e.g., TL1A, TREM1, α4β7, IL-1α/β), advanced ADC platforms, psychiatric discovery, next-gen Alzheimer’s Aβ mAb

4) Q&A Highlights
- Skyrizi/Rinvoq dynamics and 2027 bridge:
  - Upside driven largely by share capture across indications; IBD a standout
  - 2027 new breakdown: Skyrizi ~$20B (PsO/psoriatic ~$12.5B; IBD ~$7.5B); Rinvoq ~$11B (Rheum ~$4.8B; Derm ~$2.5B; IBD ~$3.7B)
  - Post-2027: continued growth expected; Rinvoq likely faster (five new indications add ~$2B peak)
- Pricing: low single-digit rebate pressure; Part D a discrete 2025 hit; no evidence of IRA spillover to commercial pricing
- Part D redesign: net -~4% growth headwind; modest volume offset (limited to standard-eligible Medicare, ~1/3 of book)
- Aesthetics:
  - U.S. Q4 share: Botox low–mid 60s; Juvederm low–mid 40s; share loss dispersed across competitors; early share recovery after Allē reversion; 2025 likely trough with gradual improvement
  - Obesity drugs: near-term share-of-wallet headwind, longer-term aesthetics tailwind via funnel; providers using as patient acquisition channel
  - 2025 Q1: one-time negative price adjustment from Allē re-implementation
  - Long-term 2025–2029 high-single-digit CAGR implies >$7B by 2029
- Pipeline specifics:
  - Teliso-V: potential 1H25 approval (CMET ADC in NSCLC; high unmet need)
  - ABBV-400 (TMAB-A): moving to Ph3 in CRC; broad lung program; combination potential seen as key growth unlock
  - ABBV-706: SCLC data in 2025 could enable registrational path
  - Venclexta: MDS Ph3 OS readout in 2025; filing anticipated if positive
  - Tavapadon: positive Phase 3; filings post LT safety; positioned as mono and add-on
  - Imraclidine: recalibrated strategy (adjunct in schizophrenia; monotherapy in neurodegenerative psychosis; dose-ranging to reassess schizophrenia mono)
  - NLRX1 agonist (ex-Landos) in UC: robust Ph2 underway; could be Ph3 and/or combo with Rinvoq if data are positive
- Cerevel impairment: reflects timing/probability updates for imraclidine; Tavapadon value unchanged (accounting prohibits write-up despite improved outlook)

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand/trends:
  - Immunology markets healthy: PsO/IBD high-single-digit growth; AD mid-teens; RA low–mid single digits
  - Skyrizi and Rinvoq still gaining share across indications; IBD and AD momentum building
  - Neuroscience and oncology provide diversification; aesthetics expected to recover gradually
- Costs/margins:
  - 2025 adj. operating margin ~47% despite Part D/FX headwinds; strong FCF and deleveraging path intact
- Capital allocation:
  - Dividend growth, ~$3B debt paydown in 2025; ample BD capacity focused on next-decade growth drivers
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Upward revision to 2027 Skyrizi+Rinvoq target (>+$4B to >$31B)
  - Clear quantification of Part D impact (~4% headwind) with modest volume offsets
  - Aesthetics guide reset to a high-single-digit 2025–2029 CAGR with 2025 likely trough

6) Takeaways
- Ex-Humira engine is outperforming: Skyrizi/Rinvoq set to reach ~$24B in 2025 and >$31B by 2027; IBD and AD key growth vectors; pricing headwinds manageable.
- 2025 set for robust growth despite headwinds: ~+$2.5B revenue growth on top of ~$3B Humira erosion, ~4% Part D headwind (~$2B), and FX; margins expanding and FCF strong.
- Oncology pipeline depth improving: ADCs (Teliso-V, ABBV-400, ABBV-706) and ELAHERE underpin a more competitive solid tumor portfolio; Venclexta MDS a 2025 catalyst.
- Aesthetics near-term reset, long-term intact: 2025 likely trough with Allē fix and international pipeline launches; long-term high-single-digit CAGR to >$7B by 2029.
- Balanced risks: Part D pressure and aesthetics macro persist; Imbruvica competitive pressure; execution on ADC combos and immunology combos (incl. co-formulations) are key swing factors for post-2030 growth.
