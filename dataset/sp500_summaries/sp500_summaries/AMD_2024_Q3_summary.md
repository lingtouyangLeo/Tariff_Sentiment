  - MI300X adoption broadened: Microsoft (multiple Copilot services), Meta (broad inference deployment incl. Llama 405B; expanding to training where TCO is attractive).
  - Cloud instances expanded (Microsoft, OCI, specialty AI clouds); customers include Essential AI, Fireworks AI, Luma AI, Databricks.
  - Software: ROCm matures rapidly (v6.2): inference +2.4x since launch, training +80%; >1M models supported; deepening open-source support (Triton, Llama Stack, SGLang, VLLM, TensorFlow; JAX, VLLM, Triton).
  - Product roadmap: MI325X production shipments start in Q4’24; broad system availability Q1’25. MI350 series in 2H’25 with largest gen leap; MI400 (CDNA Next) in 2026. Annual cadence established.
  - Supply chain: tight industry-wide but AMD has secured capacity across the chain to support growth.
- ZT Systems Acquisition:
  - Strategic move to add rack/cluster-level systems capability; accelerates end-to-end AI solution delivery.
  - HSR waiting period cleared; closing expected 1H’25; plan to divest ZT’s US manufacturing business at close; strong buyer interest.
- Client (PC):
  - Revenue +29% YoY; strength in Ryzen 9000 desktop and Ryzen AI 300 mobile; Ryzen 9000 X3D gaming CPUs shipping in November.
  - Commercial momentum improving (AstraZeneca, Bayer, Shell, VW, etc.); Ryzen AI Pro 300 launched; HP/Lenovo tripling Ryzen AI Pro platforms in 2024; >100 Ryzen AI Pro commercial platforms targeted in 2025.
- Gaming:
  - Revenue -69% YoY on semi-custom decline (channel inventory reductions at Microsoft/Sony).
  - PS5 Pro announced with new AMD semi-custom SoC.
  - Preparing RDNA4 GPU transition; first RDNA4 GPUs early 2025; higher gaming and ray tracing performance plus new AI capabilities.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Data Center GPU growth and 2025 outlook:
  - Raised 2024 to >$5B on faster ramp and milestone completions; 2025 outlook positive but quarterly ramps may be “lumpy” due to large customer deployments and varied cooling/rack preferences.
  - Expect growing workloads at existing hyperscalers; broadening engagements; MI325X and MI350 seen as catalysts.
- Gross margin trajectory:
  - 2024 improvement driven by mix (Data Center >50% of revenue). 2025 tailwinds: growing data center CPU/GPU, enterprise server expansion, embedded recovery; headwind: client mix (consumer focus) below corporate average. Scale and operational efficiency to aid margins.
  - Instinct margins below corporate average near term; expected to improve with scale; long-term data center margins above corporate average.
- Supply:
  - Tight environment persists; AMD secured capacity and planned for significant 2025 growth.
- EPYC vs GPU spend:
  - CPU demand resilient; expanding workloads; Turin well-optimized for both traditional CPU and AI head-node roles; portfolio breadth (Zen 3/4/5) supports varied TCO needs.
- Client/PC:
  - Strong H2 on product launches; expect normal seasonality in H1’25; AI PC and Windows 10 EOL are catalysts. AMD underrepresented in client—sees share gains in consumer and enterprise.
- Inference vs training:
  - 2024 Instinct skewed to inference (MI300 memory capacity/bandwidth advantage); training adoption growing; expect more balanced training/inference mix in ~12 months.
- Competitive positioning vs Nvidia:
  - AMD believes MI325X competes well vs H200; MI350 vs Blackwell. Emphasized faster software maturation, easier retrofit into existing data centers, and customers’ desire for alternatives.
- Embedded trends:
  - Expect gradual recovery; strength in test/emulation and A&D; watching comms/industrial; modest growth into 2025.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward demand:
  - Data center AI demand remains “insatiable”; AMD expects AI accelerator TAM to grow >60% CAGR to $500B by 2028.
  - Customers expanding Instinct workloads; hyperscalers and enterprises deepening engagements.
- Cost/supply outlook:
  - Supply tight but manageable; inventory build supports data center ramps.
- Capital allocation:
  - Continued buybacks; ongoing strategic R&D and go-to-market investments; ZT Systems acquisition to enhance systems capabilities; plan to divest ZT manufacturing asset at close.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Upward revision of 2024 data center GPU revenue to >$5B; Q3 DC GPU scaled faster than expected; Data Center now 52% of total revenue; MI325X shipments starting in Q4.

6) Takeaways
- Data Center led the quarter; Instinct GPU ramp and EPYC CPU share gains drove record revenue, margin expansion, and EPS growth.
- 2024 Instinct revenue raised to >$5B; 2025 outlook constructive with annual product cadence (MI325X Q4’24/Q1’25 availability, MI350 2H’25, MI400 in 2026) and stronger software stack.
- Q4 guide implies another record quarter, driven by Data Center and Client; margins stable around 54% with mix and scale benefits.
- Client momentum solid on Ryzen 9000 and Ryzen AI 300; expect normal H1 seasonality but 2025 tailwinds from AI PC and Windows 10 refresh; commercial PC share opportunity.
- Risks/uncertainties: ongoing supply tightness; quarterly lumpiness in large AI deployments; gaming weakness during semi-custom digestion and RDNA4 transition; uneven embedded recovery (comms/industrial).
