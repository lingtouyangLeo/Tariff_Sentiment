*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: American Express (Ticker: AXP)
- Period: Q1 2025 (calendar quarter)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Management characterized the environment as increasingly uncertain but saw steady customer activity vs. 2024.
  - Early Q2 (first ~1.5 weeks of April) spending consistent with Q1 across T&E and goods/services and across U.S. consumer, commercial, and international.
  - Strengthening USD remained a modest headwind to reported revenue growth.
  - 2024 leap-year created ~1ppt drag on YoY growth comparisons this quarter.
  - Management most sensitive to white-collar unemployment for AXP’s affluent base; CECL scenarios now assume a peak weighted-average unemployment of ~5.7%. Potential tariff risk would most acutely affect SMEs.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: $17.0B, up 8% FX-adjusted (9% ex-leap-year impact).
- EPS: $3.64; Net income: $2.6B.
- Spend:
  - Total billed business +6% YoY reported (+~7% ex-leap year).
  - Goods & Services outpaced 2024 growth rates; T&E steady vs most of 2024.
  - Airline spend decelerated sequentially; restaurants and lodging remained strong; front-of-cabin airline spend +~11%.
- Lending/credit:
  - Loans and cardmember receivables +7% FX-adjusted.
  - Net interest income +11% FX-adjusted (higher net yields).
  - Delinquencies and write-offs below pre-pandemic and flat YoY; provision ~$1.2B with a small reserve release.
- Fees/mix:
  - Net card fees +20% FX-adjusted; record level; 27th straight quarter of double-digit card-fee growth.
  - ~3.4M new cards; ~70% of new accounts on fee-paying products; average fee per new account up ~40% over 3 years.
- Expenses/capital:
  - Variable Customer Engagement (VCE) to revenue ratio: 43%.
  - Rewards expense +16% YoY (lapping a prior-year model benefit and small program changes increasing URR in the short term); expected to return to more historical growth for the rest of 2025.
  - CET1 ratio 10.7% (target 10–11%); ROE 34%.
  - Capital return: $1.3B (dividends $0.6B; buybacks $0.7B); dividend hiked 17%.
- Guidance (maintained):
  - 2025 revenue growth: 8–10%
  - 2025 EPS: $15.00–$15.50
  - Guidance incorporates a tougher macro backdrop (incl. CECL unemployment peak of ~5.7%).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth drivers:
  - Continued focus on premium customer base (higher income, high spend, strong credit).
  - Revenue mix is ~75% spend- and fee-driven, reducing sensitivity to credit cycles.
  - Strong demand for premium, fee-based products; Millennials/Gen Z accounted for >60% of new consumer accounts, remain a key growth engine.
  - Product refresh cadence continues; fee increases tied to demonstrable added value (e.g., Gold dining focus, Resy/Tock ecosystem).
  - SME ecosystem build-out: Kabbage platform (spend, cash flow, checking, loans), B2B automation via OneAP/Nipendo, and new expense management via the Center acquisition to create an integrated suite over time.
- Cost/investment posture:
  - Expense flexibility primarily in marketing and operating expense lines; rewards/CEMS naturally flex with spend.
  - Will not cut strategic tech/product investments merely to hit near-term EPS; remains long-term focus.
- Risks noted:
  - Macro uncertainty; potential tariffs would most affect SMEs.
  - White-collar unemployment is the key watch item for AXP’s base.
  - FX headwind persists (though somewhat less than anticipated).

4) Q&A Highlights
- Spending “pull-forward”: Management not seeing meaningful pull-forward; slight SME wholesale stocking but minor; record travel bookings through Amex Travel, including international.
- Guidance resilience: Confident in achieving EPS at lower end of revenue range if needed; aspirational 10% revenue growth, but prioritizes long-term investments over short-term EPS protection.
- Tariffs/credit risk: SMEs most exposed; risk models updated dynamically; portfolio more premium than 2019; Millennials/Gen Z and low-tenure delinquency metrics outperform industry and pre-2019.
- Fees/refresh: Many refreshes in progress; fees raised only when value is increased more than commensurately; environment does not change value-based fee decisions.
- Millennials/Gen Z: U.S. spend +~15% YoY and ~35% of U.S. consumer spend; international +~22%; they spend ~20% less and revolve less than older cohorts; average acquisition FICO ~750.
- SME tech stack: Center closed “yesterday”; will integrate into Kabbage over time (bank holding company hardening first); objective is one ecosystem covering spend, B2B, expense management, travel.
- Expense flex: Marketing/OPEX can be dialed; rewards flex with spend. Tech roadmap and major refreshes continue through the cycle.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand trends: Stable spend across categories and customer segments into early Q2; continued strength in restaurants/lodging; airline mixed with premium cabin resilient.
- Cost outlook: Rewards growth normalizing after Q1; substantial flexibility in marketing/OPEX if needed; ongoing tech investments maintained.
- Capital allocation: Target to return ~80% of earnings over time; dividend increased; buybacks ongoing within CET1 target.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Maintained guidance despite embedding a higher unemployment scenario in CECL assumptions.
  - Record travel bookings; steady early Q2 spend.
  - Rewards expense elevated in Q1 due to model effects but expected to normalize.

6) Takeaways
- Premium engine intact: Fee revenue, premium products, and Millennial/Gen Z acquisition continue to drive growth; card fee growth +20% FX-adjusted, 27 straight quarters of double-digit gains.
- Stable spend and credit: Billed business growth steady; credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic with a small reserve release despite higher macro uncertainty.
- Guidance reaffirmed: 8–10% revenue growth and $15.00–$15.50 EPS maintained, even with a tougher CECL unemployment scenario; early Q2 spend trends supportive.
- Expense flexibility with long-term bias: Marketing/OPEX can flex, but AXP will prioritize tech and product refresh investments over near-term EPS optimization.
- SME ecosystem build-out: The Center acquisition completes a key capability (expense management) to deepen SME relevance and retention; integration into Kabbage to follow.
