1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: CoStar Group, Inc. (Ticker: CSGP)
- Period: Q1 2024
- Macro/industry context:
  - CRE: Office vacancy 13.8% (19 straight quarterly increases); office attendance up 2–3% YoY but office-using job growth down. Construction pipeline at 10-year low; starts at record low, setting up future premium office shortages. Industrial demand down 90% vs 3-year average; vacancy up to 6.2%. Retail vacancy near all-time low (~4%).
  - Residential: High mortgage rates still constraining listings; recent rate declines lifted existing home sales to ~500k/month; further rate declines could spur activity.
  - Legal backdrop: Class-action settlements (NAR-related) remove buyer-broker comp fields from MLS feeds and require signed buyer-agency agreements before showings—seen as pressuring “lead diversion” portal models; management positions Homes.com’s “Your Listing, Your Lead” as aligned with emerging rules.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives:
  - Homes.com launch: Fastest product ramp in company history; 8,000 memberships sold in <2 months of selling at ~$475–$500/month; 90% choose 12-month contracts. Net new bookings company record $86M (40% residential, 60% commercial).
  - Brand/traffic: Homes.com marketing (Super Bowl-led) drove 4.5B impressions in ~2 months; unaided awareness up from 4% (Jan) to 24% (Mar). Homes.com 110M monthly unique visitors in March; residential network 156M; company-wide web traffic 170M avg monthly uniques in Q1 (+93% YoY).
  - Matterport acquisition: Definitive agreement at $5.50/share (~$2B gross price; ~$1.6B EV). Plan to make 3D digital twins ubiquitous across CoStar marketplaces; bundle into Homes.com membership. Management sees data/AI upside (better AVMs, property analytics), traffic/engagement lift (e.g., on Apartments.com: 16.6 minutes vs 7.1 without 3D; 10x more leads when listings include Matterport).
  - UK: OnTheMarket traffic surpassed Zoopla per Similarweb; 17M MAUs in March (+107% YoY), ~50% more agent leads; >15k advertisers; listings +~40% YoY.
- Product updates:
  - Apartments.com: $255M revenue (+21% YoY), fifth straight quarter ≥20% growth; ARR >$1B; 73k properties advertising (record), small property advertisers +31% YoY; GA MAUs ~43M; strong brand (51% unaided awareness) and ad campaign (12B impressions expected in 2024).
  - CoStar (info): $250M revenue (+11% YoY), ARR >$1B; 221k subscribers; strong growth in lender (+57% revenue; 285 institutions) and hospitality (STR sales +44%; hospitality subs +15%).
  - LoopNet: $69M revenue (+9% YoY), 13M MAUs; net new bookings +147% QoQ; new president Ben Drew (ex-TripAdvisor/Viator).
  - Ten-X: Trade rate up to 56% from 48% in Q4; average bidders 3.2 vs 2.3 in Q4.
- Organization:
  - Sales force: ~1,200 at Q1-end; plan ~1,500 by year-end. Dedicated Homes.com team in Richmond targeting >300 sellers by YE (80+ onboarded and productive).
  - CFO transition: Scott Wheeler delivered farewell remarks (retiring). Successor not detailed on call.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Homes.com sales dynamics:
  - Mostly outbound plus strong convention-driven demand; demo-to-close often same day; short cycle; unique offering means limited head-to-head “win/loss” comparisons.
  - Demo-to-close conversion: Solid double-digit (management referenced 20–30% range).
  - Penetration: Demos to ~7% of ~540k core prospects; early sales equate to ~1% penetration of 500k+ target agent list. TAM for basic membership estimated >$3B.
  - Pricing: Basic tier expected to stay ~$475–$500/month; no near-term premium tiers until penetration reaches teens/20s, though clear demand exists for premium placement.
  - Run-rate exiting Q1: Remains solid; aspiration to reach 100k members “sooner rather than later,” with potential for “hundreds of thousands.”
  - Non-listing members: Value from exposure (directory, neighborhood expertise positioning) and retargeting; legal changes may tilt advantages toward listing agents over time.
  - Incentives/coverage: Broader sales teams likely to keep selling Homes.com through 2024; shift more to dedicated Homes team in 2025 as Richmond scales; ~200 reps already refocused on core products.
- Apartments/CRE environment: Elevated multifamily vacancy (~9.1%) likely persists 2–3 years—supportive for ad spend; unit deliveries remain high (2024: ~495k vs 2023: 583k).
- Margins/spend cadence: Non-residential margins on track for ~42% FY; residential spend peaked in Q1/Q2 with a decline through the year; overall FY investment envelope unchanged from February.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Residential: Strong Homes.com pipeline; rising brand awareness; traffic momentum; legal shifts seen as favoring “Your Listing, Your Lead.”
  - CRE: Management upbeat on medium-term office supply dynamics (future shortage of premium space) despite current weakness; Ten-X indicators improving (trade rate, bidders).
- Cost outlook/capital allocation:
  - Matterport funded ~50% cash/50% stock; net cash use $550–$600M; CoStar maintains strong balance sheet (cash cited at ~$5.85B pre-deal).
  - Salesforce investment to support Homes.com scale-up; marketing heavy in 1H, tapering thereafter.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Q1 revenue above guidance high end; residential revenue outperformed; raised FY revenue and EBITDA guidance; Homes.com exit run-rate raised to $130–$140M (from $100M).

6) Takeaways
- Homes.com is scaling faster than any prior CoStar launch: strong bookings, pricing acceptance, and rapid brand/traffic gains validate the model and monetization.
- Matterport acquisition is strategically central: expected to enhance engagement, lead-gen, and data/AI capabilities across platforms, with potential EPS neutrality/slight accretion in year one post-close.
- Apartments.com remains a growth engine: +21% revenue, ARR >$1B, low TAM penetration (~12%), supportive rental market conditions likely continue near term.
- Commercial core is resilient: CoStar info +11% and LoopNet +9% despite tough CRE markets; non-residential margins remain high; Ten-X operating metrics improving.
- Risks/uncertainties: Sales substitution toward Homes.com modestly tempers growth in other segments; CRE macro remains weak; legal/regulatory evolution in residential could shift models industry-wide, though CoStar sees its model advantaged.

- Customer metrics: Company-wide renewal rate 90%; 5+ year customers at 94%; annual contracts 81% of subscription revenue.
