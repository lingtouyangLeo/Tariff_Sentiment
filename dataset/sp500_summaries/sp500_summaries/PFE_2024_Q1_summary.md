Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)
- Period: Q1 2024 (calendar fiscal year)
- Context: Management characterizes the post-COVID environment as challenging, with continued decline in COVID product demand but enduring revenue/cash flow contribution from Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Strategic focus on five priorities: oncology leadership, pipeline acceleration, maximizing new product performance, cost realignment/margin expansion, and disciplined capital allocation. Ongoing U.S. policy backdrop (IRA, Part D redesign) presents both headwinds (mandatory price cuts) and demand tailwinds (lower patient OOP, vaccines with no cost-sharing).

Headline Financial Results
- Revenue: $14.9B, down 19% operationally YoY (−$3.5B). Ex-COVID (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), revenue grew +11% operationally.
- EPS:
  - Reported diluted EPS: $0.55
  - Adjusted diluted EPS: $0.82; benefited from stronger gross margin and cost control. Includes a favorable Paxlovid U.S. government product return adjustment contributing ~$0.11 EPS.
- Margins: Adjusted gross margin 79.6%, up 530 bps YoY, aided by mix (lower Comirnaty), a one-time Paxlovid return reserve adjustment, and manufacturing cost discipline. Management still guides to full-year gross margin around low-70% due to back-half Comirnaty mix pressure.
- Operating expenses (adjusted): $5.9B, +1% YoY; SG&A +3% (launch and acquired products), R&D $2.5B (−1% YoY), with spend reallocation and Seagen assets offsetting vaccine program reductions.
- Cash/Balance sheet: Operating cash flow expected to be below typical levels in the next couple quarters due to timing. Debt paydown ~$1.25B in Q1 and ~$1.0B in May; monetized Haleon stake by $3.5B (ownership lowered from ~32% to ~23%).
- Guidance:
  - Revenue: $58.5B–$61.5B (unchanged). Comirnaty ~90% of 2024 sales expected in 2H, mostly Q4.
  - Adjusted diluted EPS: raised by $0.10 to $2.15–$2.35 (includes ~($0.40) dilution from Seagen financing).
  - Cost program: On track for ≥$4B net savings by YE24; multi-year margin expansion focus.

Management Commentary
- Oncology: Q1 oncology revenue +19% operationally YoY, driven by Seagen portfolio integration and strong PADCEV launch in 1L urothelial cancer (EV-302), continued Xtandi demand, and Lorbrena growth; full FDA approval of Tivdak in recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer. Integration progressing well with cross-trained field teams and strong colleague retention. 2030 oncology goals include doubling treated patients, expanding blockbusters (≥8), and materially increasing biologics mix for durability versus IRA/biosimilar pressures.
- Pipeline progress:
  - Oncology: Phase 3 starts for next-gen CDK4 inhibitor and integrin β6-directed ADC; additional multiple myeloma studies (Elrexfio). Upcoming ASCO data across tumor areas, including five-year outcomes for Lorbrena.
  - Respiratory vaccines: Abrysvo delivered positive Phase 3 data in high-risk adults 18–59; filings planned. Second-season durability data and streamlined administration presentation expected to support fall RSV season.
  - Hematology: U.S. FDA approval of gene therapy for hemophilia B (first gene therapy approval for Pfizer in hemophilia). PDUFA for marstacimab (weekly, flat-dose SC for hemophilia A/B) expected before YE. Initiated Phase 3 for next-gen HbS polymerization inhibitor in sickle cell disease.
- Commercial execution/new products:
  - RSV (Abrysvo): Positioning for fall with retail contracting progress and strong non-retail presence; potential label expansion to 18–59 at risk; pursuing ACIP engagement.
  - Neurology (Nurtec): Strong demand/TRx leadership (~49% TRx share), but Q1 revenue impacted by seasonal gross-to-net dynamics, payer mix, and a one-time prior-period GTN adjustment; execution focus on access and DTC.
  - GI/Immunology: Velsipity push for access as first-line advanced therapy in moderate–severe UC; Litfulo (alopecia areata) access/uptake initiatives.
  - Hematology (Oxbryta): Reframing SCD care toward proactive/chronic treatment.
  - Core brands: Protecting/growing Prevnar franchise, Eliquis (with BMS), Vyndaqel/Vyndamax.

Q&A Highlights
- RSV seasonality and competition: Market shows clear seasonality; Q1 decline expected; Pfizer expects a strong fall season aided by non-retail strength, retail contracting, potential 18–59 label, and durability data. International approvals and recommendations progressing (EU/UK/Japan/KSA; growing non-U.S. maternal and adult adoption).
- IRA and Part D redesign (2024–2025): Vaccines benefit from zero cost-sharing; OOP caps and smoothing expected to support volumes in parts of the portfolio (e.g., Vyndaqel). Company not quantifying 2025 impact yet; Eliquis negotiation led by BMS with outcome transparency by September for 2026 pricing.
- Gross margin trajectory: Q1 uplift driven by mix, one-time Paxlovid return adjustment, and cost control; expect compression in 2H from Comirnaty seasonality; full-year still around low-70%. Unlikely to drop below 70% in any quarter.
- Seagen integration/financial impact: Strong early commercial performance (PADCEV, Tukysa) and rapid R&D activation (new Phase 3 starts). Management remains “cautiously optimistic” but maintains prior accretion/dilution expectations (2024 ~($0.40) EPS dilution).
- Vyndaqel/Vyndamax IP: U.S. patent term extension expected through Dec 2028; no expectation beyond that date. Key EU markets patent expiry Nov 2026; Japan patent 2026 with regulatory exclusivity to Mar 2029 for cardiomyopathy.
- Paxlovid: Finalized U.S. government return credit; favorable $771M revenue adjustment in Q1; underlying demand solid (~2M U.S. scripts in Q1); smooth commercial transition; Medicare pricing dynamics differ in 2024 and normalize to list-price framework in 2025.
- Pneumococcal vaccines: Adult market maturing/contracting; Pfizer holds ~98% share in adult; defending with portfolio contracting and workflow simplicity; pediatric PCV20 driving growth (share ~80% by Q1 exit). International: pediatric approvals expanding (EU, Japan, Australia); early adult momentum in markets like Germany/France post recommendations.
- Capital allocation: Dividend prioritized and reaffirmed; deleveraging next; limited near-term BD/bolt-ons; selective asset monetization (e.g., Haleon) and potential manufacturing asset opportunities considered for return optimization, not to fund dividend.
- Obesity: Danuglipron once-daily full dataset mid-year; decisions thereafter. Broader, active obesity/metabolic strategy continues with multiple clinical and preclinical programs.
- Selected upcoming R&D catalysts: Marstacimab approval decision; DMD gene therapy advancing (RMAT designation secured); COVID+flu combo vaccine Phase 3 readout (18–59); ponsegromab (cachexia) mid-pipeline data; ASCO: Lorbrena 5-year data; Breakwater (BRAF+ CRC); ER pathway programs (ER degrader/PROTAC; CDK4) including second-line and first-line strategies.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Cautiously optimistic; execution-focused; conservative guidance stance to preserve credibility after 2023 COVID volatility.
- Demand trends: Non-COVID portfolio robust; RSV and pediatric PCV20 positioned for growth; Vyndaqel strong expansion with rising diagnosis rates; Nurtec demand solid despite GTN headwinds.
- Cost outlook: ≥$4B net savings by YE24 on track; manufacturing cost programs are multi-year with more impact in 2025–2026.
- Capital allocation: Dividend “sacrosanct”; deleveraging continues; Haleon monetization underscores balance sheet discipline.
- Surprises vs expectations: Strong Q1 gross margin; favorable Paxlovid return adjustment; slight EPS raise; Seagen integration with minimal disruption and early growth; Vyndaqel significant outperformance.

Takeaways
- Non-COVID portfolio strength (+11% op growth) and disciplined cost control offset COVID declines; EPS raised to $2.15–$2.35.
- Oncology strategy gaining traction: Seagen integration effective; PADCEV/Tivdak/Lorbrena momentum; multiple Phase 3s initiated; notable ASCO presence.
- Vaccines: Abrysvo poised for a stronger fall with potential 18–59 label and durability data; pediatric PCV20 conversion fueling Prevnar growth even as adult market matures.
- IRA/Part D: Mixed impact; vaccines and OOP reforms support volumes, but mandated price cuts are a headwind; company defers 2025 quantification pending negotiations (Eliquis update by September).
- Balance sheet/capital returns: Dividend priority reiterated; deleveraging and Haleon monetization advance flexibility; near-term BD muted.

Other Notable Information
