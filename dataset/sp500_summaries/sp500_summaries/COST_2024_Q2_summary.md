Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST)
- Period: Fiscal Q2 2024 (12 weeks ended February 18, 2024). Management also reported February retail sales (4 weeks ended March 3, 2024).
- Context: Inflation essentially flat; lower freight and some commodity costs enabling price cuts. Gasoline price deflation modestly pressured reported comps. Global supply chain reroutes (Panama Canal, Red Sea) causing 2–3 week delays but largely planned for; minimal pricing impact due to contracts. Strong traffic, renewed momentum in discretionary categories, continued market-share gains. Cultural continuity emphasized as CFO transitions.

Management Commentary
- Growth/strategy
  - E-commerce: +18% ex-FX; strength in gold (and recently silver), appliances, gift cards, e-tickets. App improvements (iOS homepage load <2 seconds vs. ~8 seconds), Apple Pay launched online (web and mobile) 2/28. Mobile now ~60% of e-com traffic/orders.
  - “Why buy at Costco” and “price you see is the price you pay” campaigns highlight total value (e.g., appliances, tires, TVs, mattresses), supporting share gains in big-ticket categories.
  - Costco Logistics scaling: >1M Q2 deliveries (+28% YoY); shortened delivery windows (incl. 2-hour options), improved value and service for appliances, TVs, furniture, mattresses; handling ~70% of >4M annual U.S. big-ticket drops in-house (vs. 0% pre-2020 acquisition).
  - Costco Next: 70 brand sites live; ~15 in development; likely ~90 by year-end; broadening assortment at Costco value pricing.
  - China: Launched same-day delivery (within ~8 km) from Pudong; rolling to all Shanghai locations and Shenzhen; strong social engagement. Continued robust interest (e.g., Shenzhen opening crowd, cross-border members from Hong Kong).
  - In-warehouse upgrades: Food court replacing churro with 5.5oz cookie ($2.49) and new turkey sandwich ($6.99) rollout; in-house sushi pilot (Issaquah) with near-term expansion.
- Pricing/inflation: Q2 inflation “essentially flat.” Costco is taking price reductions where possible (examples across batteries, beverages, frozen fruit). Lower freight and commodity costs underpin actions. Fresh remains highly competitive with ongoing investments.
- Operations/throughput: Sustained high volumes; alleviating congestion via additional units in dense markets. Planning to surface warehouse inventory online to steer members to nearby in-club pickup (often lower price than online).
- Culture/leadership: Foundational priorities unchanged (customer, employee, supplier, then shareholder). CFO transition to Gary Millership effective March 15; Galanti to retire (including board) next January. Emphasis on continuity under CEO Ron Vachris and long-tenured operators.

Q&A Highlights
- Membership fee increase: “When, not if.” No formulaic trigger; metrics (renewals, signups, loyalty) strong. Timing likely after CFO transition.
- SG&A leverage threshold: Historically 4–5% comp to leverage; could drift slightly higher given environment, but post-COVID productivity gains remain. Expense control improved via tighter labor-to-sales budgeting while continuing wage investments.
- Discretionary rebound: Stronger big-ticket trends attributed to clearer value messaging and logistics/service upgrades; appliances up >20% vs flat industry (Circana); tires even stronger. Not uniform across all categories, but share gains evident.
- Kirkland Signature: Long-term penetration typically climbs ~25–50 bps annually; during peak inflation it accelerated, now normalizing. KS typically ≥20% cheaper than leading brands at comparable or better quality; higher KS penetration in paper and other heavily inflated categories.
- E-commerce/Instacart: Instacart contributes ~1.5–2% of total sales but is excluded from Costco’s e-com reporting (Instacart shops in-warehouse). Digital outreach improvements (e.g., “7 Days of Spring”) measurable and contributing to better e-com momentum.
- Retail media: Building a more experienced team; runway to grow advertising dollars while preserving member value.
- Membership sharing: Some abuse increased with COVID/self-checkout; Costco tightened checks (incl. at self-checkout; testing entry scanning in some markets). Modest net positive on signups; primarily a fairness/hygiene action.
- International/new markets: Early renewal rates lower in new Asia clubs due to initial “looky-loo” signups; improve over several years. Broader International renewal rates (ex new clubs) trend up like U.S./Canada. U.S. still has more runway than previously thought.
- Growth cadence: Expect 25+ openings per year, trending higher toward high 20s over time; hands-on model governs pace; timing slippage normal.
- Credit card economics: Potential U.S. late-fee caps could alter partner economics; too early to quantify; options exist with issuing bank.
- AI: Early innings; evaluating use cases with major providers; more to come under new CFO.

Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand/trends: Traffic robust; discretionary categories improving; e-commerce accelerating. Inflation flat, enabling price investments. Fresh remains competitive.
- Cost outlook: Freight and select commodities down YoY; modest logistics/supply chain delays but manageable. Wage investments ongoing.
- Capital allocation: $6.7B special dividend paid in January; expect lower interest income going forward. FY24 capex $4.4–$4.6B focused on new units, logistics, digital.
- Expansion: 28 net new units targeted for FY24; multi-year trajectory implies 25+ per year trending higher. China omnichannel pilots advancing.
- Surprises vs expectations: Strong e-commerce growth; notable share gains in appliances/tires; membership fee income up 8% with record member counts; gross margin up despite wage headwinds; EPS aided by a discrete tax benefit (+$0.21).

Takeaways
- Healthy topline with strong traffic and accelerating e-commerce; discretionary categories rebounding on clearer value propositions and logistics/service upgrades.
- Margin discipline intact: Core merchandise margin expanded; SG&A well-managed despite wage investments; fresh margins competitive.
- Membership engine remains powerful: Record paid households and executive penetration; renewals stable/high. Fee increase remains a “when, not if.”
- Expansion and omni capabilities scaling: 28 net openings planned; Costco Logistics and new digital features bolster big-ticket economics and member experience; China same-day pilot gaining traction.
- Risks/uncertainties: Fresh margin competitiveness, supply chain routing delays, lower interest income post-special dividend, and potential shifts in co-brand card economics; timing of MFI hike not specified.
