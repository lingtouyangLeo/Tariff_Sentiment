1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Boston Properties, Inc. (BXP), NYSE: BXP
- Period: Q4 2024 and FY 2024; provided 2025 outlook
- Macro/industry backdrop:
  - “Premier workplace” segment continues to materially outperform broader office: direct vacancy 13.2% vs. 18.8% market; +8.8M sf net absorption over last 3 years vs. -15.6M sf for broader market; asking rents now >50% premium (vs. ~40% three years ago).
  - Capital markets activity improved in 4Q; more debt availability and leasing visibility; examples include Norges’ U.S. portfolio purchase (~$500/sf, 88.5% leased) and One Vanderbilt minority interest (reported 4.3% cap).
  - Interest rates remain the key uncertainty; inflation running above target; Fed cautious; long rates up ~100 bps since the first rate cut; BXP expects lower short-term rates in 2025 vs. 2024.
  - New U.S. administration: management views lower taxes/less regulation as business friendly; concerns about tariffs (inflationary) and deficits (higher long-term yields). In Washington D.C., return-to-office (RTO) for federal workers seen as positive; limited direct GSA exposure.
  - LA fires: impact on local office market too early to assess; BXP assisting community; early signs of some temporary school needs for space.

2) Headline Financial Results
- FY 2024
  - Revenue: $3.4B (+4% YoY), driven by development deliveries.
  - FFO: $1.25B or $7.10/sh.
  - AFFO (FAD): $894M; covered the dividend by >$200M.
  - Portfolio occupancy (year-end): 87.5% (+50 bps q/q); leased 89.4%. CBD assets: 90.9% occupied; 92.8% leased.
- Q4 2024
  - FFO: $1.79/sh, in line with guidance and consensus.
  - Leasing: 2.3M sf, strongest quarter since 2Q19; 130% of long-term 4Q average; fifth-largest quarter ever.
- 2025 Guidance
  - FFO: $6.77–$6.95/sh (down ~2% at the top end vs. 2024).
  - Same-property NOI (GAAP): -1.0% to +0.5%; cash same-property NOI up to +1.5%.
  - Occupancy: average 86.5%–88.0%; slight dip 1H25 due to known early expirations; developments coming into service with low initial occupancy.
  - Fee income: $32–$38M (up ~$7M at midpoint).
  - Termination income: $4–$8M (vs. $16M in 2024).
  - Net interest expense: $610–$625M (up ~$33M YoY at midpoint), reflecting lower average cash balances (after $850M note repayment and ~$700M development spend).
  - Development NOI contribution: +$19–$22M; loss of NOI from Reston Corporate Center removal from service: -$11M.

3) Management Commentary
- Momentum in leasing and de-risking expirations:
  - 2024 leasing: 5.6M sf (+35% YoY), across 291 leases; avg term just under 10 years.
  - Early renewals cut 2026 expirations by >1.5M sf to 1.86M sf (3.8% of portfolio) and 2027 to 2.2M sf (4.4%); largest single expirations now ~134k sf (2026) and ~143k sf (2027).
  - 2025 plan: just over 4.0M sf of total leasing (incl. developments); ~2.0M sf of current vacancy and ~1.3M sf of 2025 expirations/renewals.
- Strategy and capital allocation:
  - Focus on premier workplaces; invest into demand bifurcation; avoid “market timing” on renewals.
  - Opportunistic development: 725 12th St. (D.C.)—acquired from lender for $34M (~$112/sf), demolish/rebuild 320k sf; pre-lease to McDermott Will & Emery (152k sf) and LOI for the remainder; ~$350M budget; projected initial cash yield >8%; delivery late 2028.
  - 343 Madison (Midtown NYC): 940k sf; anchor talks (150k–400k sf); plan to launch ~$2B project in 2025 (BXP 55%).
  - Residential expansion: launching two projects in 2025 (17 Hartwell Ave., Lexington, MA; and one in NY region). NY State “Site K” award (11th Ave.; 1,350 resi units incl. affordable + 450-room hotel), several years to start.
  - Delivered 300 Binney (office-to-lab, 240k sf; fully leased to Broad Institute), first-year cash yield on incremental capital 14.5%. Delivered Skymark (508 units Reston), >50% leased in 6 months at above pro forma.
  - Repositioning suburban offices to higher/best use (resi): entitlements in Lexington (312 units), Shady Grove (townhomes sale), Herndon (359-unit rental + townhomes; townhouse sites under contract).
- Risks/challenges:
  - Interest-rate path; life science softness (lab sublease competition, slower demand); West Coast fundamentals lagging East Coast; development lease-up timing.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Leasing/retention and occupancy math:
  - In non-bulky expiry years, BXP typically renews ~45–50% of existing tenants; large single expiries generally vacate and are backfilled.
  - Rule of thumb: ~3.0M sf of annual leasing equates to flat occupancy in 2025; in 2026, with low expirations, similar leasing would drive meaningful occupancy gains (100 bps ≈ 490k sf on a 49M sf portfolio).
- Concessions and rents:
  - Concessions sticky due to 50%+ build-out cost inflation; some moderation in Park Ave and Back Bay due to tightness; TI flattening in Back Bay; outside Park Ave in NYC, availability still pushes concessions.
  - Face rents rising in Back Bay and Midtown (double-digit in Park Ave area), approaching new-construction economics; less constructive elsewhere.
- Market color:
  - San Francisco: early signs of recovery; AI-related demand; positive 4Q absorption; BXP upgrading amenities (Embarcadero “Mosaic,” 680 Folsom lobby/roof deck) and spec suites; 535 Mission performing well.
  - Life science: weaker than office; some LS users taking office-only space; lab sublease supply pressuring shell lab economics.
  - RTO: improving; clients want co-located in-office days, limiting space-savings from hybrid schedules.
- Developments/occupancy optics:
  - 2025 in-service additions (651 Gateway, Reston Block D, 360 PAS) currently ~21–23% leased; if unchanged, could drag occupancy by ~70 bps; potential removals of other suburban assets could add ~90 bps; net effect modest. Expect leasing progress at 360 PAS, 180 City Point, Reston Block D; slower at 651 Gateway and 103 City Point.
- Impairments:
  - $341M non-cash impairments on three unconsolidated JVs (Colorado Center, Gateway Commons, Safeco Plaza) reflect JV accounting (“other-than-temporary” tests) amid slow leasing; do not signal strategic shifts; consolidated GAAP treatment differs for partners.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Constructively confident; clear momentum in leasing; cautious on rates. Emphasis on 2026–2027 as occupancy/earnings acceleration years (limited expirations, development contributions).
- Demand trends:
  - East Coast (Back Bay, Park Ave) tight with rising rents and scarcity of large blocks; financials expanding; law firms extending early. Midtown South seeing smaller-floor demand (20–40k sf).
  - West Coast lagging but improving; AI-led growth; spec and amenities help velocity.
  - Life science: selective, office-heavy needs; traditional lab demand still subdued near term.
- Capital allocation/financials:
  - Used $850M cash to repay maturing note; average cash expected ~$800M lower in 2025; 12% floating debt—benefit if rates cut.
  - Targeting ~$200M of asset sale proceeds (three land sites + one operating property); one land sale could slip to 2026.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Q4 FFO in line; leasing outperformance notable; 2025 FFO guide modestly lower due mainly to lower interest income, normalized termination income, and removal of NOI—core portfolio NOI stable to slightly positive on cash basis.

6) Takeaways
- Leasing momentum real and broad-based; 2024 was a step-change and 2025 plan targets >4M sf, setting up for occupancy gains in 2026–2027 given light expirations.
- Premier bifurcation persists; Back Bay and Park Ave are tight with rising rents; BXP’s portfolio positioning supports pricing power where supply is constrained.
- 2025 FFO headwind is largely financial (lower interest income, fewer term fees, pulling assets out for redevelopment), not operational deterioration; cash same-property NOI expected to grow.
- Development pipeline is a key growth lever (290 Binney fully leased for mid-2026; 360 PAS lease-up; Reston Block D), with selective high-return starts (D.C. 725 12th St. >8% initial cash yield; 300 Binney delivered at 14.5% first-year cash yield on incremental capital).
- Risks: rate volatility, life science softness and lab sublease competition, West Coast pace of recovery, and lease-up timing of developments.

7) Other Notable Information
- Investor Day: September 9 in New York City (deep dive on portfolio and outlook).
- New York “Site K” award (across from Javits): plan for ~1,350 residential units (incl. affordable) and a 450-room hotel over a podium; multi-year pre-dev/entitlement timeline.
- Suburban office-to-residential repositioning advancing: entitlements secured in Lexington (312 units); Shady Grove and Herndon townhouse sites under agreement; ongoing evaluation of additional non-producing assets for monetization.
- Reston Corporate Center taken out of service (12/31/24) to unlock ~2.3M sf mixed-use future development at Reston Town Center.
- Community response to LA fires: provided staging at Santa Monica Business Park; early, temporary school space needs may modestly absorb local vacancy.
