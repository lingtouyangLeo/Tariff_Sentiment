1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX)
- Period: 4Q24 and FY2024 results; 2025 and 1Q25 guidance provided
- Macro/industry context called out by management:
  - U.S. mortgage rates moved back above 7% in mid-December; sharp drop in hard mortgage credit inquiries late 4Q and into January

  - U.S. dollar strength a 2025 headwind (~130 bps revenue, ~$75m)
  - Government program funding mechanics changed (CMS reimbursement now 75% vs 100% for states), creating 1H25 pressure before normalizing

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic progress:
  - Cloud transformation >85% of revenue live (USIS consumer, telco & utilities now complete; Spain in 1Q25); 2024 cost reductions ~$300m, stepping to ~$360m in 2025 from decommissioning legacy systems
  - AI adoption: ~95% of 2024 new models/scores built with EFX.AI/ML (vs 70% in 2023)
  - Vitality Index (NPI as % of revenue): 12% in 2024 (~$650m new product revenue); expected >10% again in 2025
  - EWS (The Work Number): 188m active records (+20m, +12% YoY), 734m total records; 15 new strategic partnerships in 2024, including Workday
- Product and market updates:
  - Launching “twin-powered” (income/employment + credit) solutions:
    - Mortgage: credit report with TWN indicators at point of inquiry (differentiated single request); also including telco/utility attributes (NC+)
    - Auto: TWN indicators to roll out in 1H25; personal loans likely next
  - USIS: strong mortgage outperformance (pricing and pre-approval/soft-pull products); non-mortgage saw FI and auto low-single-digit growth; D2C returned to growth; telco down on tough comp; identity/fraud pressured by chargeback management
  - International: 4Q constant-currency +11%, broad-based strength (Brazil very strong); UK slower
  - Government: strong 2024; SSA federal disability verification contract extended with pricing escalators; CMS reimbursement change creates 1H25 pressure before growth returns in 2H
- Capital allocation:
  - With leverage ~2.6x and rising FCF, plan to:
    - Continue bolt-on M&A
    - Grow dividend and launch a multi-year buyback program in 2025 (timing to consider macro clarity)
- Risks/pressures:
  - Mortgage and hiring markets weaker than expected since mid-December
  - States adjusting to new CMS/USDA funding practices in 1H25
  - FX headwinds; UK economic softness
  - Mix and onboarding costs pressuring EWS margin

4) Q&A Highlights
- EWS margin contraction in 2025 despite ~7% revenue growth:
  - Drivers: lower “high-calorie” mortgage/talent volume; elevated onboarding/partner incentives after record 2024 partner adds; mix shift (growth in lower variable margin insights/education products); ongoing investment; payout ratios to TWN partners unchanged
- Mortgage metrics and mix:
  - 4Q24 mortgage ~17.7% of total company revenue
  - USIS hard inquiries (>70% of USIS mortgage revenue) disclosed for >10 years; correlation with originations remains strong
  - Mortgage revenue breakdown: >70% hard pulls; high single-digit % batch/UDM/other; remainder soft pulls
  - Pre-approval/soft-pull products grew substantially in 2024; 2025 outperformance vs hard inquiries to moderate due to larger base
  - Some lenders moving from 3-bureau to 1–2-bureau pulls in shopping phase, partly reflecting third-party pricing actions; EFX aiming to win share with TWN-enhanced credit files
- Talent Solutions:
  - Outperformed hiring market by ~8 pts in 4Q (historically HSD–LDD outperformance); timing of annual price increases affected 4Q optics
- Government:
  - SSA extension is federal; pricing escalators support 2025 (esp. 2H); CMS change pressuring 1H; government revenue exited 2024 at roughly $700m, with large manual TAM (~$5B) at the state/agency level
- 2025 BU guidance color:
  - EWS: Verification +~8% (mortgage ~+3%; non-mortgage >+9%); Employer Services ~flat
  - USIS: >+5% to ~$2B; mortgage >+8% despite -12% hard inquiries (pricing, product); non-mortgage ~+4%
  - International: ~+7% CC; UK softer; Brazil strong
  - 1Q25: EWS +~1% (Talent MSD growth; Government ~flat; Employer down MSD); USIS +~3%; International +~6% CC

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident on strategy, execution, and cash generation; cautious near term on mortgage/hiring; disciplined on costs
- Forward-looking:
  - Demand: Mortgage/hiring baselined conservatively (no rate cuts assumed); EFX expects continued TWN record growth, pricing, penetration, and strong NPI
  - Costs: Further, but smaller, cloud savings in 2025; corporate variable comp normalizes; D&A up with cloud-native systems in production
  - Capital returns: Dividend growth and multi-year buyback planned in 2025, subject to macro visibility
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Late 4Q and January mortgage/hiring deterioration drove 4Q revenue miss vs guidance midpoint (EBITDA/EPS delivered)
  - 2025 growth and margin expansion below long-term algorithm primarily due to market declines and FX

6) Takeaways
- Mortgage and hiring rolled over sharply since mid-December; EFX embeds -12% USIS hard inquiries and ~-8% U.S. hiring in 2025, driving more conservative top-line and modest margin expansion (+25 bps).
- Execution strong: first $500m EBITDA quarter; cloud transformation ~85% complete; 2024 NPI vitality 12%; EFX.AI now pervasive in models; TWN records +12% to 188m.
- 2025 playbook: Hold/increase margins with cost discipline and cloud benefits; drive ~6% CC growth via pricing, records, NPIs, and international; resume capital returns (dividend growth, multi-year buyback) while pursuing bolt-on M&A.
- EWS margin dip is mix/onboarding/investment-driven; payout ratios unchanged; structural margin strength intact as mortgage/hiring normalize.
- Differentiation ramping: Twin-powered credit files in mortgage/auto (and likely personal loans) aim to capture share—especially as some lenders pull fewer bureaus in shopping.

7) Other Notable Information
- 4Q24 business unit details:
  - EWS: Revenue +7%; Talent +2% (weak hiring); Government +11% (tougher comps than 3Q); Mortgage +17%; Employer Services -9%; EWS EBITDA margin 51.9% (+70 bps)
  - USIS: Revenue >+10%; mortgage +47%; non-mortgage ~+2.5%; USIS EBITDA margin 38.3% (up 440 bps seq), benefiting from legacy platform decommissioning
  - International: CC revenue +11%; margins 32.5% (+480 bps seq), best since 4Q20; Brazil very strong; Europe mid-single digits; UK softer
- Mortgage opportunity sizing: Market remains >50% below historic hard inquiry levels; recovery toward norms represents ~$1.2B annual revenue opportunity; at current margins, EBITDA and EPS upside would exceed previously cited ~$700m and ~$4 per share, respectively, as recovery unfolds in 2026+.
- Supplier pricing actions (third-party) are broadly dollar-similar in 2025 vs 2024; accretive to revenue, dilutive to margin rate.
- Corporate expenses to rise in 2025 (variable comp normalization; investments in tech, security, compliance).
- Credit quality/macro: Consumer generally healthy with low unemployment; subprime stress elevated; consumer confidence weaker; auto influenced by higher rates (shift to used/holding vehicles longer).
