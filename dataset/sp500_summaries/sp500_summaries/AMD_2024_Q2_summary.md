3) Management Commentary
- Strategic/Products:
  - Data Center:
    - Instinct MI300X ramp accelerating; Azure GA instances launched; strong enterprise/Tier-2 cloud traction.
    - Roadmap: MI325X in 2024 (same infra as MI300; 2x memory capacity; 1.3x peak compute vs competition); MI350 (CDNA4) in 2025 with ~35x perf vs CDNA3; MI400 (CDNA Next) in 2026.
    - EPYC “Turin” (Zen 5): up to 192 cores/384 threads, drop-in to 4th-gen platforms; production shipments started; broad availability later in 2024.
    - UALink announced with Broadcom, Cisco, HPE, Intel, Google, Meta, Microsoft; complements Ultra Ethernet for rack/cluster scale.
  - Client/PC:
    - Ryzen 9000 desktop (Zen 5); Ryzen AI 300 notebooks (50 TOPS NPU); >100 designs with Acer/ASUS/HP/Lenovo, strong early reviews.
  - Embedded/Adaptive:
    - Gradual 2H recovery expected; design wins >$7B in 1H24 (+40% YoY); Alveo V80 launched; next-gen Versal adaptive SoCs in early access with >30 partners.
- Software/Ecosystem:
  - ROCm maturing; upstreamed FlashAttention-2; day-one support for new models (e.g., SD 3.0); strong performance on Llama 3.1, including 405B FP16 in a single server due to memory capacity advantages.
  - Acquiring Silo AI (~$665M cash; expected Q3 close) to accelerate enterprise AI solutions on AMD; prior additions include Mipsology and Nod.ai; >$125M invested across ~12 AI companies in past 12 months.
- Risks/Constraints:
  - Supply tightness (HBM, advanced packaging) into 2025; multiple qualified HBM3 suppliers; qualifying HBM3e; ongoing investment in system-level solutions to aid deployment.
  - Gaming semi-custom headwinds; embedded normalization.

4) Q&A Highlights
- MI300 ramp cadence: Revenue to increase in Q3 and Q4; strong customer adoption; 2025 growth potential supported by MI325/MI350 competitiveness vs. Blackwell; MI325 contributes modestly in Q4, ramps 1H25.
- EPYC CPUs: Continued share gains; strong cloud and enterprise traction; Turin revenue contribution begins 2H24; market backdrop improving.
- Rack-scale/system integration: AMD expanding system-level investments; UALink plus AMD Infinity Fabric and Pensando networking underpin rack-scale offerings; range of MI350 SKUs (air and liquid-cooled); MI350/325 maintain infrastructure continuity for faster ramps.
- AI PC and competition: Above-seasonal 2H in Client driven by Zen 5 launches; ARM-based PCs monitored but AMD confident in positioning.
- AI monetization debate: Customers remain committed to AI capex; market large enough for multiple solutions (GPUs, custom silicon); AMD focus on deep HW/SW co-optimization with key AI market makers.
- Inference vs training: Initial MI300 deployments skew to inference; training traction growing; inference expected to be the larger market overall.
- Supply/profitability: Shipping amid tight supply; confident in continued supply increases; MI300 margins improving and already profitable; long-term accretive to corporate GM.
- Q3 guide mix: Growth led by Data Center, then Client; Embedded up single-digit; Gaming down double-digit.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Strong, broadening MI300 demand across hyperscale, OEM, and enterprise; pipeline expanding.
  - EPYC Turin poised to extend TCO leadership, aiding share gains.
  - AI PC adoption accelerating with >100 designs; potential 2025 price-point expansion.
- Cost/Capital Allocation:
  - Continued elevated R&D and go-to-market spend to capture AI opportunity; still expanding gross margin via mix and scale.
  - Ongoing buybacks with substantial remaining authorization; debt prudently managed.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - MI300 quarterly revenue surpassed $1B earlier than many expected; full-year AI GPU outlook raised to >$4.5B.
  - Turin production shipments started in Q2, signaling execution ahead of broad launch.

6) Takeaways
- Data Center strength is accelerating: MI300X cleared $1B in Q2; FY24 AI GPU guide raised to >$4.5B; EPYC CPUs growing with Turin ramping in 2H24.
- Roadmap credibility rising: Annual accelerator cadence (MI325X ’24, MI350 ’25, MI400 ’26) plus ROCm progress and ecosystem partnerships (UALink) improve competitive positioning vs. Nvidia and custom silicon.
- Client momentum improving: Zen 5 Ryzen desktop/notebook launches, AI PC leadership (50 TOPS NPU), and strong OEM pipeline support above-seasonal 2H.
- Headwinds persist in Gaming and Embedded: Semi-custom declines continue in 2H; Embedded recovery gradual despite robust design-win funnel.
- Profitability trending up but investment elevated: Mix shift to Data Center expands margins; MI300 already profitable with improving GM; supply tightness through 2025 remains a key operational watch item.

Overall: Management tone confident and execution-focused, emphasizing long-term AI share gains across hardware, software, and systems, while acknowledging near-term supply constraints and non-AI segment softness.
