3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/execution:
  - Record bookings in Q4 and FY; 22 competitive core wins in Q4; 57 in FY.
  - 15 new core contracts with FIs >$1B AUM (vs 5 in FY23); continued move up-market.
  - Technology modernization and “One Jack Henry” driving trust, pipeline access, and win rates.
  - Product focus areas: digital (Banno), payments (PayCenter, bill management from Payrailz/iPay integration), fraud (Financial Crimes Defender), enterprise payments; SMB strategy to be detailed at Investor Day.
  - Product rationalization underway (mainly in Complementary) to focus on growth/margin leaders.
- Cloud/hosting:
  - 73% of core clients hosted in private cloud; 44 in-house to hosted conversions in FY24 (15 in Q4).
  - Long runway to 93–95% hosting penetration; revenue uplift per conversion now ~1.75x (vs prior ~2x) as remaining clients skew larger; 3–5 years of migration runway.
  - Future path includes migrating some private-cloud clients to public cloud.
- Digital & fraud:
  - Banno: 179 retail and 164 business wins in FY; Q4 adds 45 retail/50 business. 924 Banno retail clients; 12.2M registered users (vs 3.2M in 2020); meaningful CU runway; “outside-the-base” strategy targeted for 2H CY.
  - Financial Crimes Defender: 52 FY contracts; Faster Payment Fraud Module: 134 FY contracts; installations underway; resources added to accelerate implementations.
- Payments:
  - Card processing: 56 FY client wins; card-related value-added services (incl. fraud) growing; earlier card production headwind resolved.
  - EPS and PayCenter performing well; >300 institutions live across faster payment rails; approx. 40% share of live RTP clients and ~30% of FedNow clients cited.
  - Bill pay evolving to “bill management” via Payrailz/iPay integration (“Journey to One”) by FY25-end; early customer interest.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Complementary Q4 softness: viewed as timing/installation mix; no structural change.
- Up-market core wins: driven by consistent roadmap execution, innovation reputation, strong service culture, and upgraded enterprise sales talent.
- CEO transition: no strategic shifts; continued focus on modernization, One Jack Henry, SMB strategy, product rationalization.
- Payments growth building blocks: EPS enhancements; bill management rollout; PayCenter “send” use cases as fraud tooling increases comfort; card VAS remains a tailwind.
- Q1 FY25 setup: modest payments growth off strong FY24 comps; hardware sales likely softer vs very strong 1H FY24; prior-year Q1 benefited from sizable software usage license deals.
- Core implementation timelines: unchanged at 12–18 months; most Q4 wins won’t materially impact FY25 core revenue.
- Pricing/competitive environment: competitive but unchanged; JKHY emphasizing execution and service.
- Free cash flow: FY24 boosted by tax overpayment and collections timing; normalized mid-60s% in FY25; Section 174 remains a headwind absent legislation.
- ROIC: 20%; expected to trend up as post-acquisition debt is paid down.
- Net interest income: positive contribution from yields on administered cash settlement balances; sustainable but rate-sensitive.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand: strong for digital, cloud, payments, and fraud; core replacement momentum accelerating up-market; migration pipeline healthy.
- Cost/margin outlook: disciplined opex; confidence in ongoing, measured margin expansion; transparency on near-term Q1 headwinds.
- Capital allocation: deleveraging, steady dividends, anti-dilutive buybacks; M&A selective, focused on public cloud-native assets that accelerate payments/SMB/digital/fraud.
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: record core wins and up-market traction; FY24 cash flow and margins ahead of initial expectations; strong payments margins.
  - Caution: Q1 FY25 revenue/margin softness guide; FY25 FCF conversion lower vs FY24 (normalization post tax/timing).

6) Takeaways
- Record bookings and accelerating core up-market momentum (15 >$1B AUM core wins) validate JKHY’s modernization strategy and service reputation.
- Healthy FY24 topline (+7%) with non-GAAP margin expansion (+60 bps) and strong cash flow; recurring revenue >91% underscores durability.
- Payments growth broad-based beyond card transactions (EPS, PayCenter, fraud VAS); bill pay evolving to bill management; faster payments “send” could unlock incremental upside.
- FY25 guide solid (7–8% revenue, +25–40 bps margin), but cadence back-end loaded; Q1 softness flagged; FCF conversion normalizing to 65–75%.
- Long runway from cloud migrations (1.75x uplift; 3–5 years) and Banno adoption (especially CUs and out-of-base), with continued product rationalization to support margins.
