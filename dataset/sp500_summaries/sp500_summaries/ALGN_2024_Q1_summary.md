3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives/product launches:
  - iTero Lumina intraoral scanner launched (new multi-direct capture platform; smaller/lighter wand; wider field of capture; faster, higher-accuracy scans; ortho workflows now, restorative workflows expected in Q4 2024). Early feedback positive; sequential Q1 equipment revenue growth atypically strong for the season.
  - Invisalign Palate Expander (IPE) launched in U.S. and Canada; regulatory approval in Australia/New Zealand. Positioned to address Phase I skeletal expansion (roughly 20% of annual ortho starts); early clinical data shows high efficacy and lower pain vs. metal expanders. Broader rollout gated by regulatory approvals.
  - Acquisition of Cubicure to enable next-gen direct 3D printing and scale for custom appliances; supports long-term manufacturing transformation.
  - DSP (Doctor Subscription Program) expansion (touch-up cases and retainers); 23k touch-up cases in Q1 (+49% YoY), adding a 14-stage touch-up option and expanding into more countries.
  - Ongoing consumer marketing at scale; significant digital impressions and traffic growth across regions; My Invisalign app at 4M downloads, 381k MAUs (+15% YoY).
- Risks/challenges:
  - FX headwinds (expected stronger dollar in Q2)
  - Manufacturing cost pressures in clear aligners
  - IPE expansion dependent on international regulatory approvals
  - Mix and discounting pressure in non-comprehensive ASPs
  - Macro uncertainty inherent, though current tone remains “stable”

4) Q&A Highlights
- Demand trends: Stable globally; no discernible March downtick; no specific benefit attributed to SmileDirectClub’s absence.
- U.S. Ortho: Improved stability; both teen and adult held up; management cautious on projecting beyond “stable.”
- Phase I/Teen strategy: IPE + Invisalign First targets younger “tween” Phase I market (~20% of starts). Acceptance will build over time; feedback loop is quick (30–35 days), but broad adoption takes time.
- Segment growth outlook: Systems & services expected to grow faster (double-digit) aided by Lumina; clear aligners mid-single-digit growth range, supplemented by DSP, IPE, and teen-season promotions.
- Operating margin cadence: Slightly up sequentially in Q2 despite FX and ongoing investments; FY margins expected slightly above 2023.
- Patient financing: Roughly one-third of U.S. cases use external financing (ortho + GP combined). Standards seen as stable; Align is supporting doctors with payment extensions and DSO collaboration.
- 3D printing scale: Investment ramp from Cubicure; Align confident in scaling direct fabrication while funding core go-to-market growth.
- Heartland Dental: Additional $75M equity (total <5%); strategic alignment on digital dentistry; no consolidation; potential mark-to-market in future periods as applicable.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Constructively confident; repeated emphasis on stability and execution; cautious not to over-extrapolate.
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Demand stable; teen season and product launches (Lumina, IPE, DSP) expected to support 2H growth despite tougher comps.
  - Clear aligner ASP slightly up for FY; mix and FX remain moving parts.
  - Capital allocation: continued buybacks (up to $150M in Q2); targeted DSO equity (Heartland) to deepen digital adoption.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Better-than-expected Q1 revenue and EPS.
  - Systems & services delivered atypical sequential growth in Q1 and strong YoY; FY growth outlook raised to 6–8%.
  - Note on Q2 revenue guide range appears anomalously high relative to run-rate; likely a transcript artifact.

6) Takeaways
- Stable demand backdrop with balanced strength across regions; teen volumes hit a record, and adult volumes also up sequentially.
- Product cycle tailwinds: iTero Lumina and Invisalign Palate Expander broaden the addressable market and support equipment and aligner growth through 2024 and beyond.
- Mix of positives and pressures: Strong systems/services growth and DSP expansion offset by FX headwinds and higher manufacturing spend in clear aligners.
- FY guidance raised to 6–8% growth with incremental revenue split roughly equally across segments; margins to improve slightly vs. 2023 despite ongoing investments.
- Capital deployment remains supportive (buybacks, strategic DSO equity) with a solid, debt-free balance sheet.

7) Other Notable Information
- DSP (touch-up) momentum: ~23k cases in Q1 (+49% YoY), expansion into additional European markets; new 14-stage touch-up offering.
- Invisalign Comprehensive 3-in-3 adoption rising; improves upfront revenue recognition and shortens deferral period.
- Deferred revenue:
  - Clear aligner deferred revenue decreased QoQ (−$26.7M) and increased YoY (+$15.8M).
  - Systems/services deferred revenue down QoQ and YoY due to shorter service contract durations and recognition dynamics.
- Marketing reach:
  - Q1 delivered ~14.5B impressions and 43M website visits globally; notable traffic growth in APAC (Japan, India).
- Share repurchase: Completed Q4’23 ASR settlement in January; 1.1M shares bought at ~$230.13 average; $650M remaining authorization; targeting up to $150M in Q2.
- Guidance note: The transcript states Q2 revenue guidance of $1.3B–$1.5B, which appears inconsistent with quarterly run-rate; investors should verify the range against the company’s published materials.
