3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives/product roadmap:
  - EPYC server CPUs: 5th Gen “Turin” ramping; strong hyperscaler and enterprise momentum; >150 Turin platforms forthcoming from major OEMs; initial 5th Gen EPYC production at TSMC Arizona slated 2H25; next-gen “Venice” on TSMC N2, silicon in lab, 2026 launch
  - Data center AI:
    - MI300/MI325X shipments supporting new cloud/enterprise deployments; >35 platforms in production
    - MI350 series (CDNA4): sampling with customers; accelerated production mid-year; claims leadership across workloads, 1.5x memory capacity/bandwidth, new data types, improved networking; stated “35x” throughput vs MI300X; Oracle multi-billion cluster (MI355X + 5th Gen EPYC + Polara 400 AI NICs)
    - MI400 series: launching next year; designed for leadership in training and inference, rack-scale focus; strong early customer feedback
  - ZT Systems acquisition closed: Adds rack-level systems design; co-designing MI400 rack solutions; accelerating MI350 time-to-market; exploring strategic partner for manufacturing business
  - AI software: ROCm cadence moved to biweekly; ROCm 6.4 improves training/inference across PyTorch/JAX/VLLM and adds cluster mgmt tools; day-zero enablement for Llama 4, Gemma 3, DeepSeek R1; >2M HF models run out-of-the-box on AMD
  - Client/Gaming:
    - Ryzen CPUs: record ASPs, strong desktop channel & gaming; new Ryzen 9950X3D; AI PC portfolio ramping (Ryzen AI Max Plus; Ryzen AI 300 series)
    - Commercial PCs: strong momentum; Ryzen Pro sell-through +30% YoY; 80% more AMD-powered commercial systems vs 2024
    - Radeon: RDNA4-based 9070 series strong demand; record first-week sellout; FSR4 ML-based rendering (30+ games now; 75 by year-end)
    - Semi-custom: YoY decline, but channel inventories normalized; demand signals strengthening for 2025; expect full-year growth
  - Embedded: Gradual recovery with 2H25 YoY growth expected; new Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs, Versal AI Edge Gen2; EPYC Embedded 9005 series; expanding edge AI (Vitis AI updates)
- Risks/challenges:
  - China export controls for MI308 (Q2–Q3 concentration), tariffs, macro uncertainty
  - Rack-scale deployment complexity (power/cooling/networking); AMD addressing via ZT integration and early customer co-design
  - Long manufacturing lead times; inventory build to support H2 ramps
  - AI diffusion regulatory framework still evolving

4) Q&A Highlights
- Client strength: Driven by richer mix/ASPs and strong desktop channel sellout; little evidence of tariff-related pull-ins; planning sub-seasonal 2H given strong 1H
- Data center GPU trajectory:
  - Q1 GPU down modestly QoQ as expected; MI325 drove demand
  - China headwind timing: majority of ~$1.5B impact in Q2/Q3; very little in Q4
  - Despite headwind, full-year data center GPU expected to grow strong double digits; H2 weighted with MI350 ramp
- Inventory: Built to support strong client/server ramps and H2 data center GPU ramp; long lead times necessitate early build
- Gross margin: Excluding Q2 charge, ~54% run-rate; second half GM expected to improve slightly with data center mix, offset by client/gaming strength
- Rack-scale and interconnects: AMD believes it has necessary pieces and partnerships; focus on interoperable networking and customer-specific reference architectures; ZT central to simplifying deployments for MI400
- TAM/Regulation: ~$500B AI accelerator TAM assumption already contemplated China constraints; AI diffusion rules under discussion with U.S. government to maintain global ecosystem competitiveness
- Embedded: Book-to-bill and orders improving (notably A&D, test/measurement); industrial slower; Q2 flat-ish, growth resuming in H2
- Inference trend: Growth in reasoning and distributed inference aligns with AMD strengths (memory bandwidth/capacity); customers using multiple models; ROCm optimizations focus
- Custom ASIC vs GPU: Both have roles; GPUs favored due to rapid model evolution and TCO/choice; AMD targeting competitive inference and growing training relevance

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward look:
  - Confident on strong double-digit 2025 revenue growth despite $1.5B China headwind
  - H2 uplift driven by MI350 ramp, continued EPYC share gains, stronger semi-custom, Embedded recovery
  - Capital allocation: Continued buybacks; integration of ZT to speed systems solutions
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Stronger-than-seasonal client and Radeon performance; record client ASPs
  - Large Q2 inventory charge (~$800M) lowering reported GM to ~43% (ex-charge ~54%)
  - Maintaining Q2 revenue despite $700M China headwind; guide midpoint still +27% YoY

6) Takeaways
- AI accelerator roadmap de-risking: MI350 mid-year ramp with strong customer interest and Oracle scale-out; MI400 on track for next year with ZT-driven rack-scale solutions; full-year DC GPU still expected to grow strong double digits.
- EPYC momentum broadening: 5th Gen “Turin” driving share gains across cloud and enterprise; 2H25 TSMC Arizona production, 2026 “Venice” on N2 extends leadership.
- Client outperformance quality: Strength rooted in mix/ASPs and genuine sellout in desktop/gaming and commercial PCs; planning conservatively for 2H after a strong 1H.
- Regulatory headwinds manageable: ~$1.5B 2025 revenue hit from China MI308 licenses largely contained to Q2–Q3; limited Q4 exposure; AI diffusion rules remain an uncertainty being actively managed.
- Margins resilient ex-charge: Underlying GM ~54% with potential slight improvement in H2 on data center mix; watch near-term impact of inventory provisions and the pace of MI350 ramp.
