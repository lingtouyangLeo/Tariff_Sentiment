  - Total sales up 6.9% organic; 7.5% excluding COVID testing.
  - Segment highlights: Medical Devices +12%; EPD (branded generics) ~+8%; Nutrition +3.5%; Diagnostics -1.5% (COVID and China VBP pressure).
- EPS:
  - Adjusted EPS $1.26, +11% YoY and +16% QoQ; above consensus.
- Margins:
  - Adjusted gross margin 57% (+100 bps YoY).
  - Adjusted operating margin 22.9% (+100 bps YoY).
- FX:
  - Q2 sales +0.5% tailwind YoY; FY sales impact now roughly neutral; Q3 reported sales expected +~2% from FX.
- Guidance:
  - Q3 2025 adjusted EPS: $1.28–$1.32.
  - Management reiterates commitment to high single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth for 2025; second-half growth de-risked for diagnostics headwinds.
  - Diagnostics headwind estimated at ~$700 million (≈750 bps to FY25 diagnostics growth).
  - Tariffs: ~<$200 million FY impact; FX still a YoY EPS headwind but less severe than earlier in the year.

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic/operational highlights:
  - Medical Devices:
    - Diabetes Care (CGM): Libre sales $1.9B, +19.5%; strong U.S. (~+26%) and OUS growth; Epic EHR integration launched; dual-analyte glucose+ketone sensor completed five trials; extensive pump-integration plans.
    - Electrophysiology: double-digit growth; OUS limited launch of Volt PFA balloon; TactiFlex Duo U.S. pivotal enrollment completed ahead of schedule.
    - Structural Heart: +12%; share gains in TAVR (Navitor), strong TriClip adoption; MitraClip next-gen launched; Tendine (TMVR) FDA approved; transfemoral TMVR received Breakthrough, pivotal to start next year.
    - Cardiac Rhythm Management: +10%; AVEIR leadless pacer accelerating adoption (physicians trained +50%, implants/day doubled); next-gen AVEIR with +25% battery life; CSP pivotal targeted 2026.
    - Heart Failure: +14% (VADs and CardioMEMS both double-digit).
    - Vascular: +3.5% (imaging, closure, ESPRIT BTK).
    - Neuromodulation: +4% led by Eterna SCS OUS.
  - EPD (Branded Generics): Nearly +8%; “Key 15” markets topped $1B quarterly sales. Biosimilars: 10 filings across EM; first launches targeted 2026 (small market launch as early as this year), focus areas include autoimmune, oncology, women’s health, GLP‑1 access.
  - Nutrition: +3.5% overall; Adult +6.5% driven by Ensure and Glucerna.
- Risks/challenges:
  - Diagnostics: China VBP/volume shortfall timing pushed to Q4; COVID testing decline; U.S. foreign aid funding reduction for HIV testing.
  - Tariffs impacting COGS in 2H; FX remains EPS headwind YoY.
  - Infant formula litigation: company stands behind product safety; notes small revenue exposure; would reassess availability if scientific/regulatory standards not respected.

4) Q&A Highlights
- 2025 headwinds and 2026 setup:
  - Management characterizes current diagnostics headwinds as transitory; expects lap in 2026 and is comfortable with consensus for high single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS in 2026; potential upside if EP momentum and other pipeline drivers accelerate.
- Libre/CGM:
  - CMS competitive bidding: DMEs would bid; Abbott expects minimal impact and lengthy implementation.
  - HHS wearables push could support broader Type 2, non-insulin CGM coverage; Abbott supportive, emphasizes U.S. manufacturing.
  - Dual-analyte (glucose+ketone) expected to bolster share in intensive insulin users; timeline/pricing not disclosed; five trials completed; broad pump integrations planned.
- CRM (AVEIR):
  - Sustainable outperformance; launched in 50 countries; training and procedure throughput up; next-gen battery life and CSP pivotal in 2026 support multi-year growth.
- TAVR:
  - OUS growth strong; potential share gains from competitor exit in Europe; CE mark for low/intermediate risk expected; U.S. build-out by doubling field force and expanding center access; balloon-expandable platform in development (longer-dated).
- M&A:
  - Active pipeline; focus on Diagnostics and MedTech; disciplined on ROIC and profitability; selective given strong organic pipeline.
- EPS/FX/tariffs:
  - Tariffs ~<$200M FY25 impact; FX a modest EPS headwind (~nickel) at current rates; second-half guidance de-risked.
- Biosimilars (EPD):
  - Will leverage existing emerging market infrastructure; some incremental SG&A for education; meaningful contribution expected starting 2026.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking tone: Confident on core growth and pipeline (Volt PFA, TactiFlex Duo, dual-analyte CGM, TMVR, AVEIR next-gen, biosimilars). Expect diagnostics headwinds to abate into 2026.
- Capital allocation: Open to selective M&A; investing in U.S. cardiovascular manufacturing; doubling TAVR U.S. field presence.
- Surprises vs. expectations: EPS beat; reaffirmed growth algorithm despite diagnostics/tariff headwinds; raised clarity on FX tailwind to Q3 sales; Q3 EPS guide provided.

6) Takeaways
- Core engine strong: Devices grew 12% with standout performance in Libre, EP, CRM, Heart Failure, and Structural Heart; margin expansion of 100 bps at gross and operating lines.
- Diagnostics drag is transitory: COVID testing fade, China VBP and HIV funding pressure create ~$700M headwind in 2025, but management expects conditions to normalize into 2026.
- Libre momentum and innovation: $1.9B Q2 sales; Epic EHR integration live; dual-analyte CGM poised to enhance safety and share in intensive insulin users; broader payer traction in basal and non-insulin segments.
- Pipeline depth supports multi-year growth: Volt PFA OUS launch, TactiFlex Duo, TMVR programs, AVEIR advances, and biosimilars in 2026 underpin confidence in high single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS beyond 2025.
- External factors managed but notable: Tariffs (<$200M) and FX remain EPS headwinds; Abbott pursuing structural mitigations (manufacturing, sourcing) and maintains disciplined M&A stance.
