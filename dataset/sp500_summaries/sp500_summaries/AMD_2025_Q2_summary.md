1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Ticker: AMD
- Period: Fiscal Q2 2025
- Macro/Industry context:
  - Strong secular AI-driven compute demand across cloud, enterprise, and sovereign initiatives
  - U.S. export controls curtailed MI308 shipments to China; license reviews underway at the U.S. Department of Commerce
  - “Agentic AI” and increasingly complex inference elevating CPU demand alongside GPUs
  - Console channel inventories normalized; customers building for holiday season
  - Rack-scale AI systems emerging as a key deployment model; AMD investing across silicon, software, and systems

  - Ex-charge: ~54% (sixth consecutive quarter of YoY expansion)
- Operating expenses: ~$2.4B, +32% YoY
- Operating income: $897M (12% margin) vs. $1.3B (22%) a year ago (decline due to the charge)

  - Drivers: Strong double-digit growth in Data Center (MI350 ramp), modest Client growth, Gaming flat, Embedded returns to growth
  - No MI308 China revenue included (licenses under review)

3) Management Commentary
- Data Center:
  - Segment revenue: $3.2B, +14% YoY; -12% QoQ (export control impact)
  - CPU (EPYC): Record cloud and enterprise sales; 5th-gen “Turn” shipments ramped; 33rd straight quarter of YoY share gains; >100 new EPYC instances launched; nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances globally
  - AI GPUs (Instinct):
    - YoY decline due to MI308 China restrictions and transition to MI350
    - MI350/MI355: Volume production began in June; steep 2H ramp; cited competitive to B200/GB200 with TCO/performance advantages (up to 40% more tokens per dollar for large-scale inference)
    - Broad adoption across hyperscalers/AI firms/OEMs; 7 of top 10 model builders use Instinct
    - System-level solutions: Example Oracle >1,000-node cluster using MI355x + 5th-gen EPYC + Polara SmartNICs
  - Software:
    - ROCm 7 launched with >3x inference/training performance vs prior gen; broader framework support (e.g., vLLM, SG-Lang); Day-0 support for leading open models
    - Introduced ROCm Enterprise AI for easier enterprise deployments
    - Launched AMD developer cloud for instant GPU access (revenue immaterial near term)
  - Roadmap:
    - MI400 series (2026): Up to 40 PF FP4, +50% memory/bandwidth/throughput vs competition; Helios rack-scale platform (up to 72 GPUs/rack), targeted 10x generational performance on frontier models; strong early customer interest
- Client & Gaming:
  - Segment revenue: $3.6B, +69% YoY, +20% QoQ; operating income $767M (21% margin)
  - Client revenue: $2.5B, +67% YoY (record desktop CPU sales; richer ASPs; strong Ryzen 9000/X3D, Threadripper launch; premium notebook share up with Ryzen AI 300; commercial PC traction across HP/Lenovo/Dell)
  - Gaming revenue: $1.1B, +73% YoY (semi-custom recovery and holiday builds; Radeon 9000 series strong; 9600 XT extends RDNA 4 to mainstream)
  - New engagements: Multi-year custom silicon with Microsoft for next-gen Xbox (consoles/PC/handhelds); deeper collaboration with Sony (Project Amethyst)
- Embedded:
  - Revenue: $824M, -4% YoY, flat QoQ; OI $275M (33% margin)
  - Mix-driven margin decline; signs of recovery in test/measurement, comms, aerospace; expect sequential growth in 2H25
  - Portfolio adds: Spartan UltraScale+ 4; Versal wins (e.g., Bosch RoboTaxi controller)
- M&A/Strategy:
  - ZT Systems acquisition added rack/data-center-scale design talent; integration underway to accelerate Helios deployments
  - Agreement to divest ZT manufacturing to Sanmina for ~$3B cash/stock, expected close near end of 2025
  - Continued software M&A: Briam, Lemony; prior additions include Nod.ai, Mipsology, Silo.AI
- Regulatory:
  - MI308 China export licenses under review; AMD expects to resume shipments upon approval; inventory mostly WIP (not finished goods), so ramp will take time

4) Q&A Highlights
- Client sustainability/pull-forward: Management sees minimal pull-forward; expects some growth in 2H but a bit below seasonal; continued ASP uplift and enterprise share runway (HP/Lenovo/Dell)
- China MI308:
  - No Q3 revenue assumed; licenses under review; once approved, shipments resume; inventory largely WIP, requiring a couple quarters to work through; limited near-term Q3 contribution
- Sovereign AI (2026):
  - Additive to hyperscaler/AI-native demand; initial deployments on MI355, progressing to MI400/Helios; timing depends on regulatory pathways; sovereign ramps likely later than hyperscaler/NeoClouds
- Gross margin trajectory:
  - MI margins a little below corporate average but improving with scale and operations; focus on maximizing gross margin dollars; corporate GM held ~54% despite GPU mix via richer EPYC/Client mix and ops efficiencies
- MI350 ramp/size:
  - Faster/stronger than expected; Q3 up YoY and grows into Q4; MI355 seen as competitive vs B200/GB200; developer cloud not material to revenue
- Seasonality:
  - Q3: Client up single-digit; Gaming flattish vs strong Q2; Q4 gaming down strongly (console seasonal drop), likely segment down
- Lead times/visibility:
  - Supply lead times ~8–9 months; MI350 benefits from existing infrastructure; MI400/Helios co-development with customers already underway
- Data center CPUs:
  - Continued share gains; cloud capex includes significant CPU; AI drives higher CPU demand for general-purpose compute

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand outlook:
  - Robust AI demand with accelerating MI350 adoption; strong EPYC momentum across cloud/enterprise; embedded stabilizing; console cycle normalized
- Cost/margins:
  - Corporate GM stable at ~54% ex-charges despite GPU mix; MI margins improving trend; strong operational execution
- Capital allocation:
  - Healthy FCF; active buybacks; proceeds expected from ZT manufacturing sale; continued investment in AI roadmaps and software
- Regulatory/supply:
  - China license approvals represent upside optionality; ramp constrained by WIP-to-finished conversion timing
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - MI350 pulled in and ramping ahead of schedule; Client/Gaming significantly stronger YoY; data center GPU adoption pace improving

6) Takeaways
- MI350 ahead of plan; Q3 guide implies majority of sequential revenue increase from AI GPUs, with data center growing double digits QoQ and instilling confidence into Q4.
- CPU engines firing: EPYC set records with broad cloud/enterprise adoption; agentic AI is structurally lifting CPU demand; Client business delivering richer mix and enterprise share gains.
- Margins resilient: Despite GPU mix and charges, ex-charge GM is ~54%; operations and mix (EPYC, commercial client) offset GPU dilutive effects.
- China is upside, not baseline: Q3 guide excludes MI308; licenses under review; inventory mainly WIP implies a measured ramp once approved.
- 2026 setup: MI400/Helios targeting rack-scale leadership with strong early interest; path to “tens of billions” hinges on gigawatt-scale deployments across hyperscalers/AI-natives with sovereign AI additive thereafter.
