# Analysis: ABBV_2025_Q2.txt

*Model: gpt-5*

---

1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: AbbVie (ABBV); Fiscal: Q2 2025
- Context: Management emphasized continued momentum in the ex-Humira portfolio (immunology and neuroscience) and an active BD cadence to seed growth into the 2030s. Aesthetics remains pressured by macro consumer softness. Policy watch items include potential tariffs (Section 232) and the IRA negotiation process; management expects limited 2025 tariff impact given inventory and broad US manufacturing, and noted a favorable IRA orphan exemption change benefiting Venclexta.

2) Headline Financial Results
- Q2 results:
  - Revenue: $15.4B, >$400M above plan; operational growth vs. prior year (FX modestly favorable).
  - Adjusted EPS: $2.97, $0.11 above guidance midpoint; includes $0.42 headwind from acquired IPR&D.
  - Tax rate: 16.2%; net interest expense: $678M.
  - Segment highlights:
    - Immunology: >$7.6B; Skyrizi $4.4B; Rinvoq $2.0B; Humira ~$1.1B (declining with biosimilars).
    - Neuroscience: ~$2.7B, +24% op; Vraylar $900M (+16% op), Botox Therapeutic $928M (+14% op), Ubrelvy $338M (+47% op), Qulipta $267M (+77% op), Vialev $98M (sequential +56%).
    - Oncology: nearly $1.7B; Imbruvica $754M (−9.5%); Venclexta $691M (growth).
    - Aesthetics: nearly $1.3B (−8% op); Botox Cosmetic $692M; Juvederm $260M; category softness persists.
- Guidance:
  - FY25 revenue: $60.5B (raised by $0.8B; +$1.5B since start of year).
  - FY25 adjusted EPS: $11.88–$12.08 (raised by $0.21; excludes future acquired IPR&D).

  - Product/TA FY25 updates: Skyrizi $17.1B (+$0.6B; split ~$11.3B psoriatic/$5.8B IBD); US Humira $3.0B (−$0.5B); Neuroscience $10.5B (+$0.3B); Imbruvica $2.9B (+$0.1B); Venclexta $2.8B (+$0.1B).
  - Q3 outlook: revenue ~$15.5B (≈+1% FX tailwind); adj EPS $3.24–$3.28 (excludes acquired IPR&D).

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy and growth engines:
  - Immunology: Skyrizi and Rinvoq remain core growth drivers; combined capture of ~50% of in-play Crohn’s and ~33% of in-play UC patients in the US. Skyrizi continues to gain across psoriatic disease; IBD still early in adoption arc. Rinvoq momentum broad-based; new GCA launch progressing; next wave indications (alopecia areata, vitiligo, HS, lupus) expected to add ~+$2B to peak sales collectively.
  - Neuroscience: Strong, diversified growth across Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, and CGRP portfolio. Qulipta outperformed topiramate in head-to-head (TEMPL) on discontinuations and efficacy, supporting earlier-line use. Vialev Parkinson’s launch exceeding OUS expectations; US Medicare coverage ramp expected late 2025; broader PD portfolio (Vialev, Tavapidon) seen as multi-billion-dollar LT opportunity.
  - Oncology: Imrelus (ADC) FDA accelerated approval in high-CMET NSCLC; next-gen CMET ADC (TMAB-A) showing encouraging ORR/DOR; multiple ADC and TCE programs advancing; BPDCN program (PIVAC) aiming for regulatory submission this year.
  - Aesthetics: Category weaker than historical trends due to prolonged consumer and macro headwinds and sentiment shifts (e.g., “natural look” concerns affecting fillers). AbbVie focused on loyalty (Allē), injector training, consumer activation, and pipeline (Trennabot E short-acting toxin expected 2026 commercialization) to re-accelerate when conditions improve; market share remains stable.
- BD/Pipeline:
  - >30 BD transactions since beginning of last year. Recent: Gubra (long-acting amylin for obesity), planned acquisition of Capstan (in vivo CAR-T platform), ISB 2001 trispecific for myeloma, ADARx siRNA collaboration. Internal combo programs in immunology (e.g., lutikizumab combos) and multiple myeloma TCE depth (Etentimig, ISB 2001, SIM-0500).
  - Alzheimer’s: progressing next-gen anti-amyloid (Aliada platform) with BBB shuttle; aiming for SC delivery and longer half-life; expects to include cognitive endpoints, not imaging-only.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Biosimilars impact on Skyrizi/Rinvoq: Minimal net benefit; core momentum driven by data, breadth of indications, and positioning. Humira access expected to decline further in 2H as more exclusionary formularies adopt.
- Long-term targets: Tracking ahead; management to refresh multi-year guidance at an appropriate time (historically Q4/JPM).
- Tariffs: 2025 insulated; broad US footprint (11 sites) and $10B US capex (four new sites) mitigates future risk; awaiting 232 outcome; not expecting outsized exposure versus peers.
- Aesthetics: GLP-1s net neutral to portfolio; core issue is macro and filler sentiment; increased 2H activation and education planned.
- Pricing dynamics: Skyrizi 1H benefited from unique gating items and Part D redesign timing; expect back-half price headwinds; full-year pricing roughly neutral, with long-term low-single-digit concessions intact.
- IL-23 competition (e.g., Tremfya in IBD): Large headroom; IL-23 share still early in IBD; AbbVie expects strong capture given Skyrizi profile; allowance for some competitive share in planning.
- IRA negotiation: No specifics pre-November; noted favorable OBBA orphan expansion that exempts Venclexta from negotiation.
- Obesity strategy: Leverage global aesthetics footprint for cash-pay channel over time; open to adding complementary obesity assets (e.g., combinations addressing tolerability, muscle/bone loss); amylin asset has neutral pH, aiding combo potential.
- Oncology BD: Monitoring PD-1/VEGF; interest where synergistic with AbbVie’s ADCs.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking demand:
  - Immunology: Sustained share gains; IBD launches still ramping; Rinvoq label expansions to broaden reach.
  - Neuroscience: Strong volume-led growth; Qulipta H2 acceleration potential; PD portfolio building scale.
  - Aesthetics: Near-term subdued but well-positioned for recovery; short-acting toxin a catalyst.
- Costs/margins: FY margin framework reiterated; stepped-up R&D and commercial investments in high-ROI areas (neuro, immunology, PD).
- Capital allocation: Continued BD to seed post-2030 growth; no major LOEs this decade provides flexibility.
- Surprises vs expectations: Bigger Skyrizi/Rinvoq and neuroscience outperformance; stronger OUS Vialev uptake; alopecia areata data for Rinvoq exceeded internal expectations.

6) Takeaways
- Ex-Humira engine is firing: Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and Neuroscience collectively drove a beat-and-raise quarter; FY revenue raised to $60.5B and EPS to $11.88–$12.08.
- Immunology leadership strengthening: Skyrizi and Rinvoq capturing significant in-play IBD share; label expansion and head-to-head wins underpin multi-year growth.
- Neuroscience is a major pillar: Broad-based volume growth across psych, migraine, and early Parkinson’s; AbbVie expects to be the largest neuroscience company in 2026.
- Aesthetics is the soft spot: Category still below trend due to macro and sentiment on fillers; AbbVie’s share is stable, with pipeline/activation poised to help when conditions improve.
- Pipeline and BD de-risk LT outlook: Multiple late-stage readouts/approvals, active ADC/TCE franchises in oncology, and obesity/siRNA/in vivo CAR-T platforms aim to extend growth into the next decade.
