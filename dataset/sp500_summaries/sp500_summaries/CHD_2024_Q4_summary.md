4. Q&A Highlights
- Vitamins: Expect further near-term declines; inflection dependent on successful innovation and credibility with retailers; shelf space gains unlikely until trend reverses; heavy focus on online (half of category is online; ~1/3 of gummies online)
- Hero international: Similar traction as US; rapid #1 positions in patches and broader acne in many markets; pipeline yet to be fully introduced; 40 countries today, >50 in early 2025
- Focus areas under new leadership (Rick): Double down on international; place bigger bets behind needle-moving innovation; select underexploited brands to scale
- Category and promo environment: 2025 category growth assumption ~2.5%; CHD to grow via share gains; promos back to pre-COVID norms; litter promo elevated from competitor
- Gross margin: +25 bps target despite ~3% inflation; key cost pressures (ethylene/HDPE/PCR, natural gas, higher depreciation/3PL); productivity program mitigating; tariffs excluded from guidance; exposure lower than peers; plan to localize where possible
- Pricing: No broad price increases contemplated; consumer is “exhausted”; rely on productivity unless severe inflation
- ERP: No 2025 revenue impacts; SAP go-live expected 1H26
- TheraBreath: #2 overall in US mouthwash; growth concentrated in non-alcohol segment (+7%); aspiration to play across segments
- Deep Clean detergent: Highly incremental; strong retailer acceptance; strengthens “best” tier credentials
- FY25 phasing: 1Q organic ~+2% (GMG lumpiness, club promo timing); stronger H2 revenue; EPS also H2-weighted

5. Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Tone: Confident and execution-focused; candid about consumer and cost pressures; disciplined on M&A; strong cash generation and balance sheet optionality
- Forward-looking:
  - Demand: Share gains expected to continue in core categories; sizable household penetration runway for Hero and TheraBreath
  - Costs: Moderate inflation (~3%); productivity to offset; tariff risk excluded and monitored
  - Capital allocation: M&A priority #1; >$6B firepower; dividend continuity (124 years); capex low and asset-light model intact
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Q4 beat; FY24 exceeded organic algorithm
  - FY25 GM expansion below historical 50 bps (set at +25 bps)
  - No pricing lever planned despite inflation—signals confidence in productivity

6. Takeaways
- Innovation is the growth engine: Half of 2024 incremental growth came from NPD; 2025 slate is robust across laundry, litter, beauty, and vitamins; INS now 1.5–2% of sales.
- International momentum and runway: Subs and GMG both contributing; accelerated rollouts (Hero, Power Sheets, OxiClean), plus selective M&A (e.g., Graphico) and infrastructure investments.
- Digital leadership is durable: 21.4% of sales online; 82% of media digital; AI-enabled creative and PDP optimization driving higher conversion; strong online share across major brands.
- Near-term puts and takes: Vitamin softness persists near-term; gross margin expansion moderated by cost inflation; 1Q slower on mix/timing; macro consumer still pressured.
- Balance sheet and M&A optionality: ~1.5x leverage; >$6B dry powder; disciplined criteria (#1/#2 brands, asset-light, synergies, durable moats).
