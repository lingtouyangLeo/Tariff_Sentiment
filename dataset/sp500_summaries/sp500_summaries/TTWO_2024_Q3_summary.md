4) Q&A Highlights
- Guidance cut drivers (order of magnitude): 1) Match Factory UA/marketing, 2) lower mobile advertising, 3) NBA 2K24 update, 4) one unnamed title delayed out of Q4.
- FY25/FY26 outlook: FY25 net bookings tracking “a little above $7B” (budgeting in process); lifetime portfolio value unchanged; FY26 expected to grow over FY25; formal outlook in May.
- Cost savings: >$100M Zynga synergies realized; prior cost program >$50M; new plan incremental and more expansive to enhance margins/operating leverage.
- Mobile ads weakness concentrated in hyper-casual; shift to hybrid monetization (adding IAP) underway.
- GTA 6: Anticipation “much higher” than GTA 5; release timing driven by creative “perfection”; compensation aligned with TSR to balance timing vs. quality.
- Distribution/platform:
  - Open to more with Netflix where consumer value/economics align.

  - EU iOS changes still evolving; distribution costs expected to decline over time.

  - Cost discipline intensifying to drive margin expansion and operating leverage.
  - Expectation that Match Factory UA spend yields relatively quick payback next fiscal year.
  - Continued growth expected from GTA Online virtual currency and GTA+.
- Surprises vs. expectations:

  - Stronger-than-expected GTA ecosystem metrics; Netflix GTA Trilogy outperformance.
  - FY25 bookings now “a little above $7B,” likely below prior external expectations, with management emphasizing schedule shifts, not lower lifetime value.
