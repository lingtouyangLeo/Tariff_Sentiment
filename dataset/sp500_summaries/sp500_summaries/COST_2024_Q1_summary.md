1) Quarter & Company Context
- Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (Ticker: COST)
- Period: Fiscal Q1 2024 (12 weeks ended November 26, 2023)
- Macro/industry context:
  - Inflation estimated at 0%–1% YoY (down from 1%–2% last quarter); notable deflation in big-and-bulky items (furniture, domestics) tied to lower freight; TVs at lower ASPs with higher units
  - Gasoline price deflation pressured comps; FX tailwind to reported sales

  - Management intent: “first to lower prices” as costs fall; top-line growth prioritized

3) Management Commentary
- Strategy/initiatives:
  - E-commerce: First YoY quarterly growth in five quarters; strong Cyber Week (mid-teens growth), 100% site uptime; app downloads reached 30.5M (+10% QoQ). Replatforming underway (two-year roadmap ~halfway); personalization and better targeting to build over next couple of years
  - Costco Logistics: Record ~800k deliveries in Q1 (+17% YoY); strengthening big-and-bulky value proposition (delivery, install, haul-away)
  - Costco Next (curated 3P marketplace): ~65 suppliers; currently commission-based (sales not included in net sales); small but potentially accretive to margins over time
  - Merchandising highlights: Appliances up mid-20s; TVs high-single-digit sales; tires low-teens; food/e-gift cards/pet/snacks mid-teens; sold >$100M of one-ounce gold bars
  - Pricing: Actively passing through lower costs where available; intent to lead price reductions
- Risks/challenges:
  - SG&A pressure: higher wages (top-of-scale and starting rates), more labor from elevated unit growth amid deflation; some energy and pre-opening costs
  - CPG branded inflation more “stubborn” than KS
  - International expansion pacing constrained in some markets by real estate and need to seed talent from existing markets
- Leadership: CEO transition to Ron Vachris (viewed as seamless; continuity in strategy)

4) Q&A Highlights
- Membership fee increase: “When, not if”; no urgency given strong KPIs (renewals, sign-ups, loyalty). Auto-renew in U.S. ~60%
- Core margins: Small moves not overinterpreted; many moving parts; priority remains top-line growth
- Holiday/Cyber performance: Better than expected; ready operationally
- U.S. club runway: Still robust; more locations justified as many clubs exceed $300M sales; self-cannibalization used strategically to relieve very high-volume clubs
- Traffic/share drivers: Value and trust; big-and-bulky proposition with logistics and bundled services is resonating
- International growth: Opportunities across Japan, Mexico, Spain, UK additions, Australia; constraints include real estate and transferring experienced teams (hands-on model)
- Costco Next: Small today; commission-centric model akin to travel; potential long-term margin lever
- KS vs branded: KS penetration in high-20s of non-gas sales; larger deflation capture on KS than branded; ongoing new-item introductions
- Gas business: Profitability improved structurally over last 3–5 years while widening value gap vs competitors
- Shrink: Stable and low; no notable issues
- Wages: Increases assessed independently of inflation trajectory; commitment to employees; inflation moderation may ease pressure but wage progress continues

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Demand: Strong traffic; discretionary improving; seasonal sell-through “good”; e-com turned positive with momentum into holidays
- Costs/margins: Inflation easing to 0%–1% YoY; freight deflation benefits big-and-bulky; core-on-core margin up slightly; SG&A deleverage a watch item
- Capital allocation: Large $15/share special dividend funded with cash; elevated capex for acceleration in openings
- Surprises vs expectations:
  - Positive: Special dividend; better-than-expected Black Friday/Cyber Week; e-com growth after five quarters of declines; gross margin expansion aided by gas and e-com
  - Caution: Average ticket lower (gas deflation); SG&A up; no timing on membership fee hike

6) Takeaways
- Membership model remains a flywheel: record fee income, higher renewals, executive penetration rising; auto-renew ~60% in U.S.
- Top-line strength with disciplined value: traffic robust; Costco aims to lead price reductions as costs fall; discretionary mix improving without outsized margin risk
- Margin mix helpful: Gross margin expanded on gas and e-com; core-on-core up modestly; SG&A deleverage from wages/unit growth is the key offset
- Expansion and investment accelerating: FY24 net +31 warehouses and higher capex signal confidence; international growth steady but paced by real estate/talent
- Shareholder return: $15 special dividend underscores balance sheet strength; no new debt
