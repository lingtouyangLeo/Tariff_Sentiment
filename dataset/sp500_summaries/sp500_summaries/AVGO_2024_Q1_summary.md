    - Broadband: down ~30% YoY (cut from mid-teens decline)
    - Industrial: down high single-digits YoY (reiterated)

3) Management Commentary
- Strategic initiatives and growth drivers:
  - VMware strategy centered on upselling VCF (compute, storage, networking stack) to existing vSphere customers; positions VCF as an on-prem “private cloud” with public-cloud-like resiliency and low latency.
  - VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA enables VCF to run GPUs for on-prem AI—driving demand among enterprises seeking data control/privacy.
  - AI semis momentum: custom AI accelerators at two hyperscale customers remain the primary driver; strong demand for Tomahawk 5 (51T/800G) switches, Thor 2 NICs, retimers, DSPs, optical components as AI clusters scale.
- VMware bookings and trajectory:
  - Software bookings: < $600M in prior quarter to $1.8B in Q1; expected >$3B in Q2.
  - VMware revenue expected to grow double-digit sequentially each quarter through FY24.
- Portfolio actions:
  - Signed agreement to divest End-User Computing (EUC) in 2024 (EUC in discontinued ops).
  - Retaining Carbon Black; merging with Symantec to form Enterprise Security Group (minimal financial impact).
- Risks/challenges:
  - Cyclical trough in broadband; telco spend weak; recovery not expected until late in year.
  - Server/storage connectivity weakness in 1H; recovery expected in 2H.
  - Concentration: AI accelerator growth anchored in two hyperscalers.
- AI revenue update:
  - Q1 AI revenue ~$2.3B.
  - FY24 AI revenue now expected >$10B (~35% of semi revenue), up from prior ~25%; mix ~70% accelerators / 30% networking and other components.

4) Q&A Highlights
- Software/VMware:
  - Sharp bookings ramp driven by focused VCF upsell and deployment motion into top ~2,000 strategic customers; long tail continues with vSphere upsell/support.
  - Core legacy Broadcom software renewals were strong in Q1 but not the main story; overall software still guided to $20B.
  - Go-to-market: more spend on sales/support due to VMware’s broad base (300k customers), but management expects operating leverage via rapid revenue growth over three years.
- AI semis:
  - AI upside split consistent (~70/30 accelerators vs. networking); the incremental ~$2.5–$3B in AI outlook follows same mix.
  - Tomahawk 5 adoption running ahead of prior expectations driven by AI cluster buildouts.
  - Not supply constrained; customers provide sufficient lead times.
  - Customer concentration: only two hyperscalers in production for custom accelerators today; management emphasizes multi-year, strategic relationships.
  - Margin construct: consolidated AI accelerator gross margins naturally lower due to pass-through of high-bandwidth memory cost; compute logic margins comparable to corporate levels.
  - Optical ecosystem: Broadcom supplies key components (DSPs, retimers, drivers, TIAs) but does not build full transceivers; value mix still led by switches/routers vs. optical components.
- End-market trough and visibility:
  - Broadband and server/storage near trough in 1H; bookings have improved versus a year ago; disciplined 52-week lead times maintained.

5) Market/Investor Sentiment Signals
- Forward-looking commentary:
  - Confident tone: reiterated FY24 revenue and EBITDA margin despite cuts in broadband/server-storage, underpinned by stronger AI and VMware ramps.
  - VMware: sustained sequential revenue growth guided; bookings accelerating; private AI/on-prem momentum increasingly visible.
  - Capital allocation: continued deleveraging (quarterly debt paydowns), ongoing dividends; buyback authorization completed.
- Surprises vs. expectations:
  - Positive: AI revenue raised to >$10B (from >$7.5B prior); networking growth outlook lifted to >35%; VMware bookings inflecting faster than anticipated; no AI supply constraints cited.
  - Negative: Deeper cuts to broadband (-30% YoY) and server/storage (mid-20% decline) outlooks.

6) Takeaways
- AI remains the engine: FY24 AI revenue now >$10B (~35% of semi), with strong demand for custom accelerators at two hyperscalers and faster-than-expected adoption of Tomahawk 5 for AI fabrics.
- VMware is inflecting: Bookings ramping (> $3B expected in Q2) with a focused VCF upsell strategy; VMware revenue to grow double-digit sequentially all year; software still guided to $20B.
- Mixed end-markets but guidance intact: Networking outlook raised (>35% YoY), offsetting deeper broadband/server-storage troughs; FY24 total revenue ($50B) and EBITDA margin (60%) reiterated.
- Margins/FCF disciplined: Strong consolidated margins (GM 75.4%, EBITDA 60%) and FCF generation continue despite mix shifts and integration costs; steady deleveraging underway.
- Concentration and cycle risks: AI custom compute tied to two hyperscalers; enterprise/telco cycles in broadband and storage remain headwinds in 1H with anticipated 2H improvement.

This balanced profile underscores durable AI and VMware growth drivers, ongoing operational discipline, and near-term cyclical softness in certain semis end-markets.
